Robotics and a robotic company
===============================
  OODA loop (the biggest problem in Robotics is perception - of both the
  world and your self)  Which makes a fairly good quote bout human kind
  
  arrnaging the workd to be iterated ocer
  https://generalrobots.substack.com/p/the-mythical-non-roboticist
  robotics struggles because realmworld is hard
  humans have a model of the world developed ocer years
  AI tries
  education and science improces thatbmodel
  organisations live in legally mediated workd
  so models and assumptions about world can be 
  extracted made explicit - and shareable 
  SOPpy - see featiee files and regex descriotions
  if this then that - will not work all time but when it does value is immense
  we now seem to be at tippingnpoont where 
  enough point solutions exist that whole org can be 
  good enough repaced and will be quality dofference 

  each org needs a black box called "perception" - what is going on
  internally and externally, from that they can extract and cia policy 
  workmout their decisions - this is a robotics concern
  and we can reasonakly assume organisations are business rbotos
    
  so treat an org like a robot - it is seen as a person but bow it needs to 
  be a robot - "perceptiom and funding" https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39707943

  linking all subsystems together, treating internal data as single data bus
  reporting not building "enterprise systems" but sxalable smaller 
  mission control - this is the next big challenge of organsoations - at cerain point
  the mission contol becomes humans and spreadsheets - stop that means stopping feudalism moat making
