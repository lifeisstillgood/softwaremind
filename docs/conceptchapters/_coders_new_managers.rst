Management and software
------------------------

also cobra and crisis management - why treat only criss as soecial - managem this way all time - where is mist uotodate data who is involved on top 

An organisation is a machine
Typically the central nervous system has been information passed "up" the hierarchy through literate management - budgets were limiting size of unapproved action

but with software the central nervous system bypasses management reporting uowards - it's not needed, but they still exist as supervisory and budgetary and political 

but much of role is removed by software - as we move to full SOP in software it almost all goes.

management will be perfect trades unions

My inner Trades Unionist (cloth cap, beer, sandwiches)
is alive and well, but other than middle age what is droving this?

- coders are the new managers
- management by coding not writing
- encoded business models - architects dilemma
- whole org test rigs
- democracy and companies 
- the financing of companies has become entwined with the 
executive control of the compnaies. History of accountancy was a limitation or sandboxing 
not a direct control.  But the funnelling of funds 

Given that the majority of costs in texh-adjacent companies is
salary then having to finance stuff ... dunno
is there a way for financier to fund other than through executice ?

software demands business models that are encodeable. 
also 

mgmt basically untrained
mgmt incentives rarely align with shareholders - staying in the job has status and payment, share ownership rately high enough to overcoem that

Management information sustems are like software logs - you dont look at them 99% of time but when you need to debig you need them now.
The issue is that most MIS in most orgs is not automated logging and observability - its human mediated soreadheet driven and incomplete
And when mgmt comes looking for data to undersrand a problem 

1. the data is not there, incomplete or hard to interpret
2. the impressionnis *that area* needs to be fixed but it was just a passing searchlight
3. the wffort is not put into automating all data collecion amd reprotng

but it shoukd be - reprting data then building models and testing 
Innhuge amounts of cass the value of a single ERM system is it collects all the data 
in one place.

You can achieve that better / differently via reprting 
What is management for?

most orgs are communist dicatorships - communal means of production (shared treasury etc) and 
no votes on who the boss is

replace hierarchies (transmission of error / pain) wothbsoftware
and use of whole org test rig will enable many dofferent forms of org - democracy, small teams, internal markets 
and finciaer stule control of test rig (regukation) 

- theoretical co-ordination (making plans, politics of agreeing plans, engircing plans)
- actual co-ordination (markets and forcing / adjusting as plans fail)
there is a new line, 
- testable co-ordination - using software in LLE to bring the whole organisation in a test rig 
(whole organisation test rig). this will enable coders to act as true managers - will also surface 
all / most failings / conflicts interet / duolications of effort

"atrnage the workd so it is simple to iterate across"
me 

Accountancy enabked control (sandboxing, limits) but does enable positive control
there is no positive controln(projects picked not started) 
but what exists is management laters as a form of central
nervous system - reporting issues up (not allowed tomlie by accounts)
- but with software almsot all important feedback can be picked up cia software metrics

reprting via database is more effocnet than mamagement

what does managemrtn do? 

Literacy was common, but not standardised. Spelling was phoentic and varied - whereas with the invention of the printing press became more standrdises 

 Deep state note :
Nicholas II: “I never ruled Russia. 10,000 clerks ruled Russia.”

What is architecture ? Guard rails, tukes, sandboxes what you can and cannot do woth marginal cost
Also raisongnthe floor - so town planning like moves for 2ord magnitde - chaos monkey os a great town planning / architecture move cos ot forces all sorts pf behaviours and costs but in a dirdctiona stratgically benefical for a company

powerpojnts on what to do dont work
architexts are hands on - town planners are guides 
putting up bureaucratic gates is not the pijnt - chaos monkey is the point 





 


Coders are the new managers
---------------------------
It does not matter what the managers say or ask, it does not matter what the design document says. what matters is what the code says, and does.

There are processes that improve the code and processes that dont - but in the end the code is the output, software is capital and the important parts of that are the coders.

Good management helps, but it is neither sufficnet nor probably necessary

Google has stufided this and come uo
withbeifht rules - these rules are not about making decisions or influencing the code base but basically keeping the coders happy and productive (and perhaps union free)

In fifty years the idea of management has slipped from
MBA touring behemoths bestriding the world (financiers basically) to moral officers and coaches.

Yeah some form of co-ordination is needed but thats about how to take credit fot peoples work (hierarchy getting in the way*)

Financiers are still bestriding the world - see 2 orders magnitude and the point at which shared treasury joins "right aize" companies.



Management by code 
------------------
A small side note - most of us will know a manager who "used to code but stopped when went into management". But none of us know anyone who stopped reading and writing English (German, Japanese) when they went into management.
The difference might be that we don't have many companies that can be managed with code, or that a lot of people in management don't need to be there.
Edit: VW is an interesting case in point. It does not matter what a manager says, what the design document lays out. what matters is what the code says. And VW CTO knew this so he made the commits to the code base that tricked the emissions tests. That is management-by-code.
