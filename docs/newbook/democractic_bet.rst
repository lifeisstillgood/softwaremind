The Democratic Bet
====================

elon best understood as politival actor
overton indoes matters - in politics society snd of software and org aisation (lokkthe tech dmeo koves overin windoes) 


Journalist John Naughton coined the phrase "Totalitarian Bet". The idea is that
Totalitarian governments across the world are investing heavily in *surevillance
technologies* (everything from Saudi building AI data centres and China setting up
social score databases).  The idea is that these technologies will allow the governments
to *control* their populations more effectively and efficiently, thus allowing the
governments to remain in power.

Its a bit depressing.  Because its not a totally silly bet.  Its quite a good one.

I just want to bet on something else.  LEts call it the human spirit.
LEts call it reluctant compliance
Lets call it the Democratic Bet.


software literacy goes hamd in glive with democracy 
- allows fir woder corporate cultures than the never make a mistake overlat on 
pllical feidslism

and we can fix withiyt revolutiob by bring more human 
nore open more drm ratic 



Totalitarian bet is also a bet 
on democracy (or western modern democracy)

How organisations decide
------------------------

Rory Sutherland bemoaned "That all creative people have to present their ideas
for assessment and evaluation by highly rational left-brained people and
probably that's ok; I dont think you want the people that check the wheel nuts
on planes to be wildly experimental, but the thing is it never happens the other
way round, so if you have a bunch of accountants in a room they will come to a
conclusion based on their own particular formulation and they will never suggest
just throwing it out to some whacky peple to see if there are alternative
solutions" (NudgeTalkRadio #38 John Cleese & Rory Sutherland)


But, this is because the elite in the hierarchy are both having to defend their
position by only taking defensible positions (that can be seen as reasonable
bets based on known facts - ie the new political standard, the admitted culture
of modern business - as opposed to real underlying dog eat dog)

But democracy in business will I cponjecture, enforce all decisions to be open
to challenge, hence review, hence better

But most decisions in a softwre literate buinsess will be encoded in software -
so will be available for review instantly, constantly and assessment for
modelling.

Decisions can be taken, implemented, and open for review by everyone else
immediately It might even speed things up

But democracy slows things down
-------------------------------

Yeah maybe. Probably. Depends a lot on the voters, and how engaged they are.
Paypackets at risk people get engaged.



It is a constant political ebb and glow of taking other peoples other "tribes"
viewpoints, needs, weaknesses and gains and losses to evaluate what is or is not
acceptablr this is visibkeninnthing slike coujtires and shuttle diplomacy but is
part parcel of ebrry company decidingnonnits annual budget reacting to a crisis
ot opportunity its why founder led companies react faster mutate wuickrr and
also why pricate companies (dictatorships) react faster than governments but
sclerosis sets in Can democracy help. only of eberone has equal share as well as
equal say then post office is avoided as thise with power are not model of
trades unions likely to be model for mangenet as it disaggregates elwcted off
ials and move towards worker "juries" to recommedn hard choices see executives
as working at the 2(O)) boujdaries



=================================================================
The Totalitarian Bet, The democratic bet and wealth taxes
=================================================================

* totalitarian bet
lo-code is rubbish but learnign curve huge
developer tools are really litersacy tools
software will not only control the companies we work in (policy enforcement snd
impenetaiotn) but will shape how we cahnge said policies - through democracy and
through modelling - policits exists but will shift to more open and more model driven.
We hope - thsts the totalitarian bet

Future Trends
=============

Guessing future trends is a much discredited literay trend,
and I am not going to fix that. but one of the ways to avoid foolishness is
to identify not some new trend but the biggest longest trends and
assume they are jmoortant
ao what are the biggest longest trnds of the last centiry,
and how dis they impact western democracy (amd so the software world we lice in)

* biggest by far is energy (oil) - ie biggesy reaource pump
* pikkety blip - far and away most sognficiat reaource allocation issue
* impact of mass education 
* impact of mass communication (broadcast and peer to peer)

so i am going to do some Turchin style predictions here 

Energy is over. we have to handle the climate change
 (its not going to be reversed, its going to be mitigation, mass movement)

 Mass education is here to stay, we are even getting to school
leaving age 21

mass communication here to stay

so what is going to chnage western democracues ? reaource allocation - the
reversion to kean of uber wealthy holding all wealth but wealthy will face the
thrash back of So holding the line on one thing, reduced wealth inequality seems
the best long term bet. and investing in improving energy usage (but it seems we
are throwing a lot at that one anywya.) also - as infrastructre becomes
balkanised we see increased spend on maintenance but also changes jow
architecture and town olanning work - more checksums, more ledgers and more
centrakised / democtatic / legal control iver ledgers and lefger changes less
darkness by design - because risk of politibsl control we dont agrre with - eu
vs usa disagreements will allow for eu market approach henry farrell professor

Democractic Bet
---------------

That openness leads to better outcomes. Studies on agile in orgs. Military behaviour.
                           Democarcy is waaay newer than we think. And I think tied heavily to scientic method.
All the big wins have gone
- steam coal electricity electronics, medicine and public health
still huge stirdes neede but what we need now is consolidation of the wins not tremendous growth
democracy, equality and openness - to srave off r> i

beware of viewing geopolicis as a civilisationalmclash - most civilisations want the beat for citizens (and elite)
chapters in software literacy 
- 
tickets are not the best / right way to forward plan -> see moving work from team to team in devops handbook
the work is creative not operational
(i mean operational is fine but that means  you just have not automated it yet) 

leadership as form of terrorism or protection racket - I could blow up your
whole company create toxic cultures - but I won't so please pay me

=======================
Equal Say, Equal Share
=======================

The point is FDR was a traitor to his class.  And that he understood something that is
rarely accepted in political circles.  An equal say means an equal share.  And if the
answer is 'the plebs only get a say once every four years and the elite get a say every
day, look at what explicit implicit and openness directionality means.  There is only so
long people can put up with Dark Pools - isnt there?

Productivity - the key?
-----------------------
Many economists today bemoan lack of productivity growth
as a major reason for economic failings.  As an example
in UK wages have not risen since 2008 crash.  If we had enjoyed growthbrates similar to
1990-2005
or much of post war period UK worker average wage would be 10,000 GBP better off.
Thats a huge number
Now
we see computers everywhere but in the productivity numbers
Conjecture: The virtual-irl link, software / reality gap
can be bridged by software literacy in many cases (having people able to read and write,
plus aoftware that is deaigned for onward use (topless) plus
greater reach of software (sensors, actuators) will provide productivity chnages.
Most enterprises are largely over staffed - so why arent they culled??
Because most enterprises are not staffed by fools ...
well
conjecture on the theory of the firm -
- lack of insight into internal
process - ie deep state and lack automation
- the faikure of large plans - it is ventire captial
and people kind of knownot - but ahoukd embrace that majority of venture captial
is spent internally not externally.  traditional VC only gets the truly disruotive
companies - thatvwill destroy intentql homeostatis of
companies - and most companies dont face existential threats which is why silicon valley
is mostly unique - its more schumpter than the test rather than the wearher
- shared treasiry leada to funding multiple other bets
- programme mgmt isnmostly about intenal VC mgmt - and worse using politics ans not
metrics like teaction

==========================
You cannot escape openness
==========================
Bitcoin, ledgers, banking
Ledgers will be GPS of financial servixes - letting everyone know exactly what is where
this will devastate traditional banking !

Implicit is now Explicit
========================
PArt of architects paradox - enforced openness is the desitnation
oss4gov.org
Why shoukd proprietary software be used by a single payer?
the idea of outsourcing is to turn to someone with more expeirence of running a sevice -
but if you are a government there is no one more expeirenced
hence the avility of many garbage collection services
markets docide into two structures - those with low transaction costs (see below)
that naturally tend towards compeition and so stable
and thise that can be exploited

Openness ruins all of this exploitatio.

Project Oberon and an organisation ERP
it should be possible to have onne ERP ans one set of languge

NOt that complex conjecture
most organisations are not that complex - but the faikire of openness
and the complexity of deciding what to do next is the complexity

Enforced Openness
-----------------
We are leading up to the Totalitarian Bet, but its worth noting how VW emissions
        is clear in the codebase.  Its not quite like LIBOR scandal where if there had not
been texts explaining "we are going to do a crime" then there simply would have been no
proof.  This is where the code base told the Slow AI, the deep state of VW, told the whole
org, how to behave. criminally.

=================
Socialist utopia
=================

WE live in one. We are dependanet on people we simply dont know. Terry pratchett quote
about big lies like truth justice. Other lie is that people will trade without trust.
People will self harm without knowing a way back.  Northern Ireland is as good as it gets.
 HOw do we build trust in societies and in organisations?

============================
Super Co-operative Species
============================
The idea humanity is so successful because we are super- co-opearive,
                                         beyond simply working with family or local tribe,
we have discovered
                                         specialisation, trade and the enormous benefits
of being oragnised beyond
                                         our immediate tribal groupings.  ANt colonies are
amazing, but where is the inter-colony trade?

Whats the different between super co-operative and scoialism?



chapter:Feudalism, Democracy, Wealth Tax
========================================
* democracy in companyes as orgnsityiona change
  Why should those employees control those - but they already do, it’s just internal
politics, bribery
politics will not end, but democracy will change politics of elite in and out of orgs
Jp Morgan was a democratising force just like FDR using the mass of people to push aside
old feudal elites (and make new ones natch)

Chapter: MMT, Crypto, Equality, Democracy
=========================================

class war: https://billmitchell.org/blog/?p=61635
chapter - MMT, class war, wealth tax, crypto
my take is MMt is right about basics
that itnis about abolity tonput reaources if a nation / society to bear
Notth korea has one approach
the state droven is another (soviet)
Capitalism is another - elite driven
but democracy is another

democracy and capitalism are not synonymous
-------------------------------------------

Capitalism just allows pikkety returns to capital. In a social framework that
is stable and conducive to

But capitalism did not bring the wonders of the modern age - science did.

So the creation of wealth is different to the allocation of wealth

And not a single one of the lauded wealth creators came from a uber wealthy family.
Musk Gates Jobs, etc etc. Billionqaries today did not start as billionaires.

Just arguing for a wealth tax / socialprograms.

dutch in 1700s used financial methods to align
resources - as did banknof england
its leas clear where and how thise resources can be directed
financially - esp when much finance is derivative
or betting on other outcomes instead of focused on
using resources
how do we use resources - fiat crypto will likely end
banks ability to create money sonwill affect ability for koneybcrwation to reflect
real reaiurces
so what will? whomwill dorect more nurses
- equality and infrastructure  is the issue. if we were all equal, all capital holders,
all labour and all consumers
then infrasturcutre would drive agglomeration - or rather itnwould be easier to move
cities due to
climate chnage - or would it - the built environment?

Totalitarian Bet

We have 150 years apart two scandals of adukterated milk
One killing 8000, one killing 4.  the difference? Ability if people
to koin together to monitor to agitate - something like communication
without something?
From guy in guardian. Essence is that China is betting that it can control its citizens
using monitoring and social pressure.  Now worth talking about racist assumptions - china
has a hugely strong culture of familial devotion and respect built in, so this is not like
trying to monitor norweigans or Montana.
       But it is also a totalitarian regieme using reeducaton camps against racial
minority. SO its not nice.
       The problem is two fold.
       1. This is how society does work.
       2. But its how society decides what is acceptble, what is to be pubished and what
not.
       3. this is culture wars.  Is it ok for gay marriage.  My 7yo daughter knows most of
the words to Katy Perrys; I kissed a girl (cherry chopsticks!)
       It will work in reducing open dissent. But will it work in actaually changing
minds.



Theory of Great Smear
- if there is one king there is one court
and everyone can get on woth politics of personal emotions

- the more power is decolved the more people
need to donpolitcs withbothers to achieve consensus
so some political forms arr impossiblenwithout
faster communications, mass communication like newspapers
and democracy isnone suchnthing (equal share equal vote)

but rmeote work and so on leads to huge amounts of dorsctors flying around trying
to meet - can be based on vertical reporting etc
but mostly there is a limit onnamount of distributed decision
making that can be done woth hoerarchy

so swiss cantons wont work so well in china

or

we need more market like approaches (see dutch burse)
to democracy - more open decisions where the decisions are made
and implwmted

what if we do stupid dhait. yes its possible
