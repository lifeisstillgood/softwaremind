Software testing is broken and unit tests are broken - agile seems to rely on just unit tests

The three steps of software enginerring maturity
------------------------------------------------

Three std deviations.


How swardley maps fit in

How evolution of components fits in agile

Software Evolution in literate companies
========================================

..
  swardley maps
  swardley evolution of reliability
  internal software development - Agile, Lean, sixISgma

Summary
-------

We now have not only a good idea of how to map a company's strategic position,
but also a model of how software can be developed and grown organically
inside a company - a three phase cycle that allows for the build/buy decision
to be finely tuned across a company or organisation.

It is also a fine model for how developers actually work. At least the honest ones


Replacing Agile
---------------

The ultimate goal is simple-to-change designs of software ??? this gives us and company agility

We should look at organisationalmprocesses as controllable feedbackmloops - and look at the PID controller for guidance

Swardley maps give us clearer views of the landscape we operate in. 

playing the beer game with PID controllers?
