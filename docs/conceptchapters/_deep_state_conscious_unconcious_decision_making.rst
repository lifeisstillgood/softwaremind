Software Governance
===================

If more than one person works together for a commonnaim, thise people need a means of agreeing, a way to build consensus.  It might be "strong man" dictatorship or a hippie commune, but every organisation needs a form of "governance" - and this applies to what software will be written, and what thatvsoftware will so

As software eats the world, and companies become programmable companies, we need methids to decide what software to write, and how that software will behave, which will dirext how the organisation behaves.

This is goverance.  Partly project managenebt, partly democracy, all politics.

Theory of governance

All governance is consensus, all governance is trade off, all governance is politics, democracy needs institutions and norms, 

We live in very young democracies, and work in dictatorships.  We shall find new ways to open dictatorships to voting, democratic institutions and better stewardship over the resources franted the orovate secotr.

(its why I am despite my liberal leanings not a big government person - a democratic instituion trying to regulate inherently dictators is foolish - regieme change leading to dmeocratic institions. )

aoftware as capital
software that depreciates slowly and provides ongoing value.  Do not trwat it as lego, it is an ecosystem and it grows and needs to be inderstood - "fits in one brain".
