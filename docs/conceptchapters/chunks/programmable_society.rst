What is society?
================

Margert Thatcher famously declared "there is no such thing as society" - but honestly that seems silly.

Almost everyone happily agrees there is such a thing as an economy - almost all of us live in it. And if there is an economy then I am happy to argue there is a society.

A society (in our definition) at its most basic is a group of people that identifies as that group. Sometimes Londoners, sometimes football fans, or sometimes British, maybe even European (!) and occasionally global humans.  A society of parents, or workers or commuters or gay or differently abled or neural diverse or ... well there are  a lot of groups. 

And being part of a group confers some rights and some duties

A rant about rich
-----------------

Take a billionaire. Any one.
At some point they inevitably will have made a public proncement something like "Why do we bother with these useless politicians ? I am a self made man. I can make much better investment decisions than those guys.  Let me keep all my money and I will keep making better investment decisions."

Guess what - No. Maybe. Mostly  No.

Look firstly you are not a self-made man.  You are an investment from your *society* that built a school, paid the teachers, injected you with vaccines and fed your growing body and mind and after twenty years of that sent you and millions like you out to make money and give some of it back in tax to pay for the repairs to the roads and schools and hospitals.

And even after that you did not do all the work at your compmay yourself - you hired people (at a presumably fair wage) and arranged things so that more of the profits flowed to you than to them.  This was all legal. (I hope!)

But most especially you were not the only visionary in the desert. Every startup that succeeds has competitors - there is even a Sillicon Valley saying "competition is Gods way of saying there is money to be made". You gave a great pitch - but it fell on fertile ground.  Investors realised this was a good opportunity and pushed cash into your hands, engineers and sales people realised this was the industry they wanted and shoved CVs into your hands.

You did a great job as an Enteprenuer - well done.  But you were not the only one, you are not an island and you are fortunate to have benefitted from a specific corporate structure.  Imagine how rich you would be if you had started a co-operative owned solely by employees or like a Vanguard investment fund owned by shareholders (unlike most hedge funds).  you would still be rich - just normal rich.

Of course my dear self made billionaire, you probably are a better invester than our politicians, smarter too.  But that is not the point.  We are asking them to make investments that dwarf even your funds - the President of the USA hands out a 6Trillion dollar budget and that's just the federal bit. And we want a bit more ... accountability and a bit more responsiveness from the guy investing so much of our hard earned.

If you want to invest that (and let's agree you will probably do a better job) you need to persuade us (ie your new investors) that you are the right person to spend it.  So is your name on the ballot? No? ok so you are not, in our terms, handing out a prospectus.  in tat case you don't get to invest on our behalf.  how it works is that people who invest our tax money get elected.  That way we can remove them when we don't like it. (it's not a great system i have to admit but no better alternatives seem to exist)

So give us back (most?) of then money you made.  we will use it to build schools for the next entrepreneurs, and also lots of other stuff we will all massively argue about.  

In short, you are an investment in our massive VC fund, and you have paid off handsomely.  Now we want our exit please.  Death and taxes are the only two promises we ever make. 

Having said that we would be very interested in your manifesto (sorry prospectus).  Can you do anything about  the potholes round my way? 




China's Totalitarian Bet
========================

So of course when I say China i don't mean the 1.5 billion people living there, working hard and raising kids (or being kids).  I of course am talking about the few thousand  top politicians / generals who constitute the "administration".  just keep that in mind 

So this concept Inoriignally heard from John McNaughton of the Guardian.  So there is a meme that is / has been doing the rounds.  It's a little but Ra-Ra for Freedom and democracy (which I am also a little but Ra-Ra for, at least when I am in a Ra-Ra mood.  Which is less often than the chief cheerleader for the Texas something something football team, but is a reasonable level of Ra-Ra for a middle aged Brit)

Anyway the idea is that democracy and freedom means that when it comes to our armed forces 

a totalitarian society wants to control all aspects of that society (total control is kinda in the name).  And that control has issues - it's not impossible but it requires incredible amounts of data from the "edges" coming back to the centre, and it requires incredible amounts of processing to attend to abs sort all that data, and it requires effective (correct) decision making at the centre. 

Chinas bet is that they now, in the age of the iPhone
they now have the first two - enough data can be collected and enough clever algorithms can be applied (read ML) to find the important data.  And as for the third - making the right decisions - well ... everyone thinks they have that down pat anyway.

So Chinas bet is they can run a totalitarian society now.  Unfortunately there is no 'a priori' reason they are wrong.  I mean humans are pretty much a herd animal and tend to follow along for social group 
cohesion for more than we should.

Our bet, and by us Inmean the Ra-Ra freedom loving people of "Western civilisation", our bet is of course that they are wrong 

But then the corollary to that is that democracy, freedom, decentralised decision making is better.  

But we need to balance that ideological with a pragmatic recognition of the need for regulation - that market structures are created and regulated.  It is all a trade off but a trade off with 

China does not trust the owners of vast companies to make the best decisions - and they want to keep a tight leash on all such decisin s

A western liberal strawman does not trust those same owners - and wants to have transparency, openness, regulation and universal suffrage as the means to keep a tight leash on things.

There is a difference 

Longer view
-----------
200 years ago 90% of humanity lived below absolute poverty - today it is 10%.  And we have made enormous improvements in quality of life and medicine for billions.  And frankly we don't really know how we did it.  Science is almost certainly the right answer, and putting science in the driving seat of politics.  but this level of pragmatism is ... hard tom maintain.  everyone wants power, most people should not be let anywhere near it.

Countries try to replicate success - Japan / MeiJi restoriation.  but carbon copies are not ideal and ...
