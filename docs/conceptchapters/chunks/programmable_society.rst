Ben evans and car companies
===========================

First there was "what does a car look like?" 1890s to 1940s - electric steam or petrol? wheel
or levers? which side is the brake abs which side accelerator? 

the there were a few dominant t companies GM chrysler etc.  And a few state protected companies (renault, british key land, skoda)

And a few challengers decades later like toyaota.  yes google and amazon will become 
fat and slow and be disrupted in 2040 by new incumbents from Delhi and Guangdong.  but that's not the point 

the point is that we know know what a computer is - it's a smartphone (not a laptop).  my ideal is it will become foss based VR headset for proper programming

anyway google will not run every business, will not disrupt every insdutry.  (see google notes on ADT) 

but someone and something will - software literacy is at th core of this - and it is why walmart is a company that can only exist where everyone has acar - because a hyprnakrket offloads the last mile problem to the consumer in return for cheaper food and wider choice.

and we need to look at mobile phone / software similarly - what wider choice and cheaper prices coulee do you your industry? parking- so done.

Barcelona and city built around cars - this is a negative (not net negative but a huge problem in say Houston) - and it is a choice (san francisco has maximum parking for new block building lower than the minimum for LA) - and there will be negative consequences for mobile phone - as  father of three i see some (and also see benefits just cannot work out which) 

What are the most obvious issues:

1. true recommendations 
So mobile first has enormous amounts of (schien or instagram) user generated content explaining their experiences with the product.  and that is probably the strongest retailing model - but also the hardest nut to crack.  (business idea: a peer to peer recommendation engine that is *trustworthy* - good luck with that!) 

2. location 

3. discovery - what do i want - this is a curated lifestyle - or perhaps a regulated "libertarian paternalism".  We do not actually need to spend all that money - but the market will not help us !

4. software literacy 

5. politics is retail selling of political manifestos - so obviously changes in retail affect politics - but for the better or not? more democracy - more access to data - more journalism - more trust (peer to peer recommendations)" but also more bubble) 

6. Agents 
we need a lot of help. one algorithm is not going to cut it.  i could use the Guardian agent for my shopping and my purchases - this is likely to be best option before AGI - which becomes a trust issues 
but it's likely i could easily not just buy the same sports shoes and make up as kimmkhardashian but the same ISA the same ... groceries - how do you regulate that? 


What is society?
================

Margert Thatcher famously declared "there is no such thing as society" - but honestly that seems silly.

Almost everyone happily agrees there is such a thing as an economy - almost all of us live in it. And if there is an economy then I am happy to argue there is a society.

A society (in our definition) at its most basic is a group of people that identifies as that group. Sometimes Londoners, sometimes football fans, or sometimes British, maybe even European (!) and occasionally global humans.  A society of parents, or workers or commuters or gay or differently abled or neural diverse or ... well there are  a lot of groups. 

And being part of a group confers some rights and some duties

A rant about rich
-----------------

Take a billionaire. Any one.
At some point they inevitably will have made a public proncement something like "Why do we bother with these useless politicians ? I am a self made man. I can make much better investment decisions than those guys.  Let me keep all my money and I will keep making better investment decisions."

Guess what - No. Maybe. Mostly  No.

Look firstly you are not a self-made man.  You are an investment from your *society* that built a school, paid the teachers, injected you with vaccines and fed your growing body and mind and after twenty years of that sent you and millions like you out to make money and give some of it back in tax to pay for the repairs to the roads and schools and hospitals.

And even after that you did not do all the work at your compmay yourself - you hired people (at a presumably fair wage) and arranged things so that more of the profits flowed to you than to them.  This was all legal. (I hope!)

But most especially you were not the only visionary in the desert. Every startup that succeeds has competitors - there is even a Sillicon Valley saying "competition is Gods way of saying there is money to be made". You gave a great pitch - but it fell on fertile ground.  Investors realised this was a good opportunity and pushed cash into your hands, engineers and sales people realised this was the industry they wanted and shoved CVs into your hands.

You did a great job as an Enteprenuer - well done.  But you were not the only one, you are not an island and you are fortunate to have benefitted from a specific corporate structure.  Imagine how rich you would be if you had started a co-operative owned solely by employees or like a Vanguard investment fund owned by shareholders (unlike most hedge funds).  you would still be rich - just normal rich.

Of course my dear self made billionaire, you probably are a better invester than our politicians, smarter too.  But that is not the point.  We are asking them to make investments that dwarf even your funds - the President of the USA hands out a 6Trillion dollar budget and that's just the federal bit. And we want a bit more ... accountability and a bit more responsiveness from the guy investing so much of our hard earned.

If you want to invest that (and let's agree you will probably do a better job) you need to persuade us (ie your new investors) that you are the right person to spend it.  So is your name on the ballot? No? ok so you are not, in our terms, handing out a prospectus.  in tat case you don't get to invest on our behalf.  how it works is that people who invest our tax money get elected.  That way we can remove them when we don't like it. (it's not a great system i have to admit but no better alternatives seem to exist)

So give us back (most?) of then money you made.  we will use it to build schools for the next entrepreneurs, and also lots of other stuff we will all massively argue about.  

In short, you are an investment in our massive VC fund, and you have paid off handsomely.  Now we want our exit please.  Death and taxes are the only two promises we ever make. 

Having said that we would be very interested in your manifesto (sorry prospectus).  Can you do anything about  the potholes round my way?

China's Totalitarian Bet
========================

So of course when I say China i don't mean the 1.5 billion people living there, working hard and raising kids (or being kids).  I of course am talking about the few thousand  top politicians / generals who constitute the "administration".  just keep that in mind 

So this concept Inoriignally heard from John McNaughton of the Guardian.  So there is a meme that is / has been doing the rounds.  It's a little but Ra-Ra for Freedom and democracy (which I am also a little but Ra-Ra for, at least when I am in a Ra-Ra mood.  Which is less often than the chief cheerleader for the Texas something something football team, but is a reasonable level of Ra-Ra for a middle aged Brit)

Anyway the idea is that democracy and freedom means that when it comes to our armed forces 

a totalitarian society wants to control all aspects of that society (total control is kinda in the name).  And that control has issues - it's not impossible but it requires incredible amounts of data from the "edges" coming back to the centre, and it requires incredible amounts of processing to attend to abs sort all that data, and it requires effective (correct) decision making at the centre. 

Chinas bet is that they now, in the age of the iPhone
they now have the first two - enough data can be collected and enough clever algorithms can be applied (read ML) to find the important data.  And as for the third - making the right decisions - well ... everyone thinks they have that down pat anyway.

So Chinas bet is they can run a totalitarian society now.  Unfortunately there is no 'a priori' reason they are wrong.  I mean humans are pretty much a herd animal and tend to follow along for social group 
cohesion for more than we should.

Our bet, and by us Inmean the Ra-Ra freedom loving people of "Western civilisation", our bet is of course that they are wrong 

But then the corollary to that is that democracy, freedom, decentralised decision making is better.  

But we need to balance that ideological with a pragmatic recognition of the need for regulation - that market structures are created and regulated.  It is all a trade off but a trade off with 

China does not trust the owners of vast companies to make the best decisions - and they want to keep a tight leash on all such decisin s

A western liberal strawman does not trust those same owners - and wants to have transparency, openness, regulation and universal suffrage as the means to keep a tight leash on things.

There is a difference 

Longer view
-----------
200 years ago 90% of humanity lived below absolute poverty - today it is 10%.  And we have made enormous improvements in quality of life and medicine for billions.  And frankly we don't really know how we did it.  Science is almost certainly the right answer, and putting science in the driving seat of politics.  but this level of pragmatism is ... hard tom maintain.  everyone wants power, most people should not be let anywhere near it.

Countries try to replicate success - Japan / MeiJi restoriation.  but carbon copies are not ideal and ...

The wests best bet
=====•=========•••

If we see software literacy as best bet for a company to compete (we have put pens and paper on everyone's desk but 99% cannot read or write) then the same applies to democracy - the way to compete is to embrace software literacy - and FOSS embraces that - imagine a world where you have to follow the law but we're not allowed to see the laws? wtf

a world where the data is locked up and passed around by hand and not available (science)

we want to spread knowledge - of all. this is not about forcing one group to stay in charge - we think the best group should be in charge that being constantly discussed in scientific politics

and the final part is fairness - we will be happy to sacrifice control if rewards are fairly shared 


deep state - is really in transparent parts of how state functions - things like rules for maintaining nuclear missiles

and some cutbacks and efficiencies are possible - but without full open modelling you cannot know if cutbacks cut too deep

so deep state will get replaced by explicit software - which may romany both e good thing
- guess game for what department agriculture is involved in 

Future of internet
-------------------

Google is dying 
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30347719&p=2

It's worthy thinking about this because it has been the 800lb gorilla for twenty years

And it's not that there is going to be some other commercial search engine to replace it one for one.  We are talking now about how to build a software literate society - and software enabled access to a *library* of data is probably the first port of call.  Access to data (will
look something like Arrow on top of IPFS) - and search is only part of the issue : 

social media is *really* news which is really a current feed that needs journalism (human curation) so we can pick out the right bits 

but all the rest of the worlds data - i mean all of it - timetables and traffic lights and restaurant prices and even actual reviews (danger zone)

We are almost certainly going to see a PKI come in - with a crypto currency.  And everyone's business will be available - our personal tracking data everything we do will be somewhere.

but we will have nots to help find most things and fight our corner with privacy - but also remind u of failings where we have not done MOOP

Google is dying - good we need a global library not an advertising billboard 


Future of software
------------------
There will be a Dr Seuss of software, who will write software that plays with the house lights and can be read and executed and understood by children 

we have not created that language nor trained the dr aries's - but we will create the libraries and the 


Point of private business
------------------------
price discovery?
higher tempo of resource reallocation via schumpeter ?

business is less innovative than government ? funded programs of science is discovery 

from that everything has come

but organisation is the new efficiency - see nasa vs spacex 

so more often destroy orgs to find new ways to deliver - so need lower blast radius of org destruction (more gov regulation / welfare state etc) 

Why do I go on about Swardley Maps?
----------------------------
Because what makes humans successful (for at least some definitions of success) is co-operation and organisation.  we have seen science and engineering deliver value to humanity on scales that beggar belief. 

And that comes from new ways of organising 

unless we discover amazing new technologies (like the seminal nature such as electricity or oil) then the benefits to society must come from better organisation 

This may come from fairer sharing of wealth produced, as well as increasing the wealth in total.  Yea that sounds socialist, but before you have a knee jerk reaction tell me if millions in poverty is a good thing? no it's not.  and that's how we have organised the world, dictators and oppression, segregation and suppression 

measure cohesion vs morale for an organisation.  morale is mission, cohesion is infra-group identity
