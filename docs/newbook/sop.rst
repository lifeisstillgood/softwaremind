"Follow your written procedures"
SOP - standard operating procedures
Is it possible to build a (complete) 
set of software that faithfully represents 
the written policies? can we use LLMs to do this?
and if we do, will the policies have loopholes?
can we compare the generated aoftware with 
the software currenty in place (whole org test rigs)
and so dosciver missing areas?
