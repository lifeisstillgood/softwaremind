-> why is housing somexpeonsive ?

- Criminal money laundering ?
- NIMBY
- empty homes not used for tenancy / owner occupied
- who owns what

- The reverse economic model (land banking)

- the cost of building (pre fab and labour shortage)

- the rentier problem (taxing the increase in land value due to planning permission and ancillary build (train station))

- land value taxation ? 

- last two need non market valuation to be taxed on - can this be avoided? (reasonable as if all
land was taxed much would hit market at same time to pay for tax which would reduce the sell price and hence the tax level)

- perhaps assessing the cost of local public works - people get taxed proportionately to the public spend - this means the rentier problem is mitigated but also reduces to minimum what public works are needed - why have that new road? 


MOOPs and monitoring

We obviously have sattellitte monitoring of the world
But lookk at https://cotl.com.au/launch.html - range of weather stations monitoring for pestivcide runoff and spray.

We can moniotr the world - and improve it.
