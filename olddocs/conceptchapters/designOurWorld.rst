What is radical that should be done now

Edication
flipped learning
why have long summer breaks 

energy

military 
nuclear power

urban design 
car networks 
cycle networks 
Mixed zones
walkabikity / cuclability
"campus life"

manufacturing 
deno racy in companies (fighting corruotion
and corrusion)
end of financialisation / moving risk-respjnsibility along suplly chains / end of conflomerates making outputs look consistent 



A overly sinplified view ofnhisotry

- religion began to be a way of curtailing the power of the king / general in the axial age.  More and more this became "whatvare the rules everyone shoukd abey"

this is a rhread throughout as it is the socail contract.  This social contract gets reworked and renoefotiated and we are ijnmodst of one now (dmeocracy and industrial revilusiotn - software and the new one - where everyone kkowws everything)
