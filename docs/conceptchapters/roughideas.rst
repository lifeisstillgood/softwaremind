Introduction
-------------

Predicting the future is like trying to hike in a thick fog.  You can feel if the landscape is rising or falling, but pretending you know how far up the hill goes is a fools game.  Similarly, Warren Buffet likens timing the market to crystal ball gazing.

Technology is humankinds great invention - and yet it constantly changes the game - The mountains underneath our feet are shifting - some rising like software, some falling like Aluminium cutlery.

In the 1860s, Napoleon III hosted a banquet with cutlery made, not from silver or even gold, but from the then-fantastically expensive and precious metal - Aluminium.  Quite how he would have reacted to seeing how we toss away Coke cans is beyond me.  But his amazement is not birthed in changing fashions, or more industrious use of slaves, but in a technological leap that simply changed the economics of the world so much that Napolean II's mental model was no longer useful to him.

The arrival of the Internet has provoked a shift in the economics of transactions between every person on the planet.  The ramifications of this did not stop with a few big Silicon Valley IPOs but will continue to play out for decades.  The impact of free unlimited communication between individuals will impact governments, businesses, and individuals.

On top of this other maturing science is threatening to overturn our assumptions as surely as Napoleon III's - The science of articifically growing meat resulted in eating a beef burger worth 100,000 dollars in front of the press.  But no one is betting that similar burgers will never come down to restaurant prices.  

I have spent my professional adult career in the internet business, developer, manager, consultant and entreprenuer.  I have managed to live through hyper growth, spectacular launches,failed websites and  bankruptcy.  I have developed a nose for what is going to hit and how much it will hurt.

I am probably wrong in the specifics and the order of impacts - but I have learnt you only need to be standing in the right place once.  And there are many right places to stand.









New Software architectures
Business Operating System

New enabling technologies
Search for basic income
EuroZone and the quest for country sized sharing and playing nice




Data store: pickle objects and store in a "container" object that holds metadata 
Indexing is ... ?? 

This becomes the basic backbone of data storGe - store the file.  It is getting away from the RDBMS idea

How does it change the CoW problem? 

What else?

Message queue and zeroMQ
Hdf5 for tabular data 

Purchase orders etc - store as an object

Store documents in mongo or couch ... ???
Why build own store??? 

Major trends 

Distributed / decentralised 
- Bitcoin is trying this - by removing fiat the power is diffused.  As such it makes local decision making more likely
- political decentralisation 
- software decentralisation. 

Over arching thesis
- software literacy and the shape of the future fog

- radical action
It's not reckless action, but it must move a significant percentage of the economy and population - otherwise why bother having governments do it?

The UK is in the middle of a general election campaign, and every party's election promises are being shown and compared.  And they are all, with few slightly nutty exceptions, *small* changes to the status quo.

And it is similar across the western world.  "Change" is what everyone wants, but when you add up the figures, most change pales into insignificance compared to what does not change.

I think that if a party's policies, in toto, will not move the needle more than say 10% of GDP, why are we electing them?  Things are good - but they are not that good.





- software is eating the world - here are the restaurant reviews. 
- blog and podcast to discuss these.

- 
Projects
- OSS
Campaigns
- kids experiments 
- oss4gov
Etc

Healthcare: the highly leveraged US hospital based healthcare system looks fragile in the face of three pronged attacks:

- vastly improved micro-diagnostics (diagnostics on a chip, sonar grams on laptops etc, computer assisted diagnosis, fit bits)
- local procedures - my most recent surgery 
- mass procedures - Russian eye surgery, vaccination days

I see a Singapore style approach - forced saving for life long minor procedures and insurance for major procedures, combining with clearer diagnosis and localised out patient services. 

We can also see likelihood of health taxes. Want that Mars bar ? 20 quid tax.



New software architectures
------------
Parallel stream processing - the data is passed in (over network) because having all applications assuming they hold a database that is CoW is far far more frustrating for systems integration than all applications assuming messages and data and streams will be sent to them and they will process and inwardly pass on

This is as big a shift as client server in the 80s

And it means we devs get to rewrite everything - again! Cha-Ching! 

Add to this the move off RDBMS to hsf5, the move to platforms and business operating system and move to proper PKI and we are doing well.


Security
--------
Marc Andreessen podcast - target attack and fired CEO. This leaves the board I. Clear position. They want valid security audits, and the CTO in better position - she will have Board level air cover to turn to the business and say "only critical bug fixes for six mths while we sort his out"

A whole industry of "introducing security best practises".  

That's my book :-)


Software 
=======

Software literacy
Software is eating the world

Openness
Open source software
Transparent decision making
Transaction costs falling to make theory of the firm less attractive

Death of the commute 

Government - evidence-based policy
Government - open source

OTC and open markets (EMIR) regulations are basically saying if you make a trade you need to tell the world how much and with whom.  It is open trading.  The debt was hidden by ability of two parties to both claim a profit off the same derivative transaction.



Labour market hollowing out

@management API

Frictionless enterprise 
Friction in pricing adjustments
Friction in management practise
What if all human parts of lob process are replaced or guided (augmented?)
Guided like warehouse pickers




Ideas with outsized impact 
-------------------------------
"Open"
This is one of those soft, vague words.  But in the Software world it has gained a real definition as part of the Open Source Software movement.

Suffice to say that the marginal cost of producing new software dropped below the cost of free time for most Western developers.  A this point a driven software programmer could create new program's, often better program's than commercially available. This drop occurred almost simultaneously with the drop in communication price ushered in by the internet.  And a new movement was born - programmers linked by free email, exchanging software program's and building the new generation of software - and having to find new ways to do it.  

Openness has power - it is the ultimate trusted institution. What everyone knows is what everyone expects. What everyone expects, is.





Openness
- reputation
- privacy (all or nothing)
- big data - too big to hoard
- open kills many management jobs

Openness - by making auditing easier we need openness - and at a certain point we just audit by auditing every transaction - see birth of NCR.


Openness matters in reputation

In February a man I had never met held a knife to the throat of my son, and I paid him thousands of pounds. Luckily he was a respected surgeon performing a routine adenoidectomy.  But why would I let him do that? Because he was monitored, reviewed and approved by his peers using "openness".  He had no fears of his actions being avaialble to be scrutinised by his peers or an interested public.

Openness matters in privacy
We all spy or no-one spies.  Since someone will always try to pay we should probably go for all spy. 

This is my default position on privacy - that the benefits of openness and shared data are so great the downsides will be best managed.




Ownership of personal data
The most likely beneficial solution is that data 

As an aside, digital rights management is important - but the record company lawyers make us feel icky.
Digital rights might be able to enforce personal data and might be able to allow companies to defend / prevent damaging data loss.

Then again, maybe we are all better off completely open.


Death of privacy affects governments more than individuals.

Maybe ...

@finance
It's amazing but finance globally is really really inefficient.  The profit margins of world banks is a good metric for this - but it is elsewhere too.

But really for a relatively simple act - a scrip as it were, we have terrible terrible abiities.  Swift is moving towards the idea, as is visa, but if we used pgp and had every bank ... Hmm and there is the point if the blockchain - who is to trust that I have assigned actual money to my scrip? 

If banks do not exist?

But if they do how do they survive? On reputation? 



@veganism
25% of green house has emissions come from growth, transport and preparation of meat.  We could extend the "greenhouse runway" by decades by "simply" giving up meat.  We tried fairly well with net caught tuna, and we were not going to lose major cities to the dolphins.

It kills no one, is cheaper, healthier - and amazingly unlikely to happen

The BitTorrent CDN - everyone an advertiser
Noticed iTunes seems to be gel locating adverts
Now surely there is a very good possibility to stream works to me but insert ads - and as each torrent client is pushing the. There is possibility of just getting a penny for putting an ad in the stream I share

Privacy is dead but what was it?
Death of privacy for 
Failure of security services to work for the country - should be telling Apple their device is insecure and failing to protect our managers and ministers - but now they exploit it.
Legal definitions of national security
Cannot put the encryption genie into bottle without breaking security of transactions
Must look to traditional detective skills
And to resilience - something that will benefit us in the 21century


The end of money
- money can be seen as a record of value contributed.  As we do more electronically perhaps we can re think that so it is fairer ? 

Deception and authority on the internet.
To a large extent, the problem of finding authority on the internet is already solved - Google has done this with PageRank algorithm.

However this algorithm is public, but it's results are not.  This involves a discussion of intellectual property rights - and is going to be a major piece of social future discussion.  It is unreasonable that Google owns the rights to use a link as an indicator of trust.  But it is also unreasonable to argue that Google should make the results of it's spider public - they have expended energy and cost doing so, and have some right to the results

It is also unreasonable to say that I, having made a link, which cost me time and energy, should have no rights to the link.  But do I have rights to the derivative works (page ranking) based on my intellectual property? 

Future of advertising
http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/04/the-economists-tom-standage-on-digital-strategy-and-the-limits-of-a-model-based-on-advertising

Google advertising vs Apple advertising - leaks into privacy stances and so makes a huge difference in strategic stance in future.  


RoboWarrier and robocop

It suddenly occurred to me that robots will be better in (defensive) combat.  Already targeting systems "improve" human decisions (tanks fire at the most vulnerable parts of a human selected tank)

The existence of a laser able to kill a human combined with facial recognition and aiming, presents an interesting situation - a very very small number of humans could operate a very large number of gun emplacements.

In the end it matters little. We have been very good at killing our own kind for many years. 





Socrates and Economics
======================

THis is a divergance from the main discussion, so blip over if you like.
However i think this lays down a good argument

Economics is improved energy use for human utility
Socialsim / capitalsim
Shared capital - Romand aqueducts still csarrying water 2000 years later
All capitalism is is a foam on top of the capital helping us allocate scare resources in the quest to build new *shared* capital in our socialist utopia.

Socrates said so so it must be right.


We can see this in PG&E and Salt Lake Tribune
Salt lake tribune is now first local newspaper (pulitzer prize winnng)
to become a non-profit with IRS approval.  This is the start I feel of the migration of journalism from the "foam" of capitalism to the ocean of socialism -

compare this to the PG&E actions where they are turning off electircity to millions of users in case the electircity pylons fall over and start fires.

THe failure to put capital into burying the cables shows the failure of the foam to transition downwards.
