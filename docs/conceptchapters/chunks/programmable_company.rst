Software mediated policy mgmt
-----------------------------
It is policies that set us apart
policies channel values to action

soppy sop framework 
metrics -> policy trigger
policy action 
everything in a company is aligned in a metric - if it is not triggering or triggered by software it's not part of the ecosystem

create simple ownership ans responsibility 



What does a programmable company imply?

I want to hark back to my main theme - software literacy.  I find literacy such a useful comparator because it is so ingrained in our (programmed!) minds, that if we imagine a world without it so many things become clear.

So look at a typical middle manager.  He (I did say typical !) he will spend a very large portion of today reading or writing - often sadly emails and powerpoint presentations,  it such things are the APIs of other similar managers.  He will not write any code.  If he does it will be in a siloed isolated platform called Excel, and it will be topless.

Now imagine an illiterate manager surrounded  by other illiterate managers.  They won't send emails, read policy documents or work with excel.  How will they work? perhaps lots of meetings ? become good at remembering things (#)
Information is harder to share , less precision 



It is not enough to add digital technologies to a company like replacing the adding up people 

It is not enough to put the "factory floor" under surveillance, and have surveillance report to management 

The whole of a company gets to be digitised.  imagine code like

::

    for each person in project("Acme"):
        bonus.add(500.00).from(annual_bonus_pot)
        
        
* topless computing
* code is the design 
* coders are the new managers 
* immutable companies 


Let's examine an immutable company from the position of giving a bonus to a team  

In my theoretical company, a manager wishes to give a bonus to team Acme.  Is there a bonus management system that exists to let him login and do so?  manager commits and another approves ?

But isn't it more natural to write down what you want - a memo perhaps ? (bad argument)

How
much analysis will be done on jupiter notebooks?

The meetings and discussions will be on/about the company, and interpreting its performance.  this is true now, 


Why?
because every founder wants a compmay that works the way they want it - all the organisation and people "challenges" are just in the fucking way

Holy fuck 

Death of project management 
-----------------

Soldiers don't plan to be in place by 6pm to support the attack, if they have not developed the rifle already - the plan is get in place with the rifle not get in place, after inventing testing building a factory and tooling and outputting rifle, then in place for 6pm

this is same for building and releasing an immutable company - you dot put off going to market because the tooling to build an even better company is not developed - release what you have.

what we do is R&D - migrating that into market place is the coder to manager challenge

markets make societies
societies maintain institutions 

Why will companies become democracies?
-------------------------
They may lose conglomerate status - do one thing well.  and so the coders (managers) will code the company to do X and so it will be conglomerates or easier to see where not - so much harder to move to company that you agree with ? what ?
