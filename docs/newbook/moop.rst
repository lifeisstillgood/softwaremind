behind the scenes footage of your life

intro: staniless steel rat - workingnout my personal philosohpy 
conclusion: rory and younger guy 
Rory Sutherland - bes thing for customer satissfactionnonntube 
is dot mateix displays that reduce uncertainty's 

sutherland:
checklists not schedules (test lead project mamabegemebt) 


measuring and being informed makes people willing to accept 
being all in it together helps
(see failure of strategic bombing and success of military conscription)

software mind means something like this 
toes in the democracy bet and moop and 
constant widespread meansuremnt replacing accountancy as the means to run the business

we can measure more, instantly

we can model the corporate body and diagnose more wuickly

we can see our own health and benefits 

a society dedicated to the benefit of all ots members and able to measure it

MOOP

Lefgers will
transform trade because supply chain becomes visibke globally 
- its like my movements published - i cannot sneak off to hotel
it enforces honesty
its gonna be weird 
- the professionalisation of taxation and governance 
at start of american revolution meant friction and problems
moop is basically surveillance if activity - including fiat based cryptocurrency 
but it can be a good thing but also likely to be shaoed as government overreach
but only fovernment can prevent market private abuse
somunless we acxept government moop contols (nanny state)
we will see the pricate abise (advertising and worse)
so democratic bet leans on government nanny state control for important levels 
Been banging on about this for a decade. Massive Open Online Psychology. How we behave is visible to all - recordable, analyseable. Is the manager of the team following the 8 leadership principles of google? We expect the maangement to moniotr that. What if the police style body cam strapped to his tiepin just helps that? What happens when the collated experience of 100 million people are condensed into daily advice for a person living their life.
        Not merely sensible index fund investing, but best ways to act with your other half, the advice for working with kids or your manager.  What if instead of taking a pill the best life advice comes from HIPPA level app on your phone.  What if people using this for a decade are measureably fitter, healthier, happier, wealthier than the control group?
Transition layer - management does not have information systems capable of two way piercing of transmission layer - so there is a layer of people looking for and using low code solutions (incl excel) to pass data and analysis 
see that tweet ? from guy talking about using stuff in monzo 
Fiture AI
future AI is like future robot - it wont look like a butler and an AI agent persona wont have to be super intelligent
So I see MOOP as aignificant part of this - it does not take AGI to 
ot take topless computing (see European banking regulations) and it takes robust privacy laws (HIPAA equivalent)
then its a case of conversations like
- welcome Debbie ans Ian to our monthly review.
Ian there is a high soend on games - its over busget.
bit we can sdjust the fruit budgwt - yes? I can order more 
oranges this week toncompensate
Also thwre are three new jobs advertised that seem roght for you - one of which is in same company as a linkedin 2 toer contact 
Have you finiahed hanging up the last load of washing?
moop - digital archaeology 
history of a wedding ring 
surveillance - good bad or indifferbet?
----------------------------------------








Everything we do is will be monitored with sensors - that can be good

Organisational Mental Health

This is similar to, linked to SLow AI and MOOP - how do we create non-dysfunctional
organisations? How do we change ourselves and our orgnaisations. How much change to serve
the needs of the org is too much? THis is also the essence of the Democratic / Totalitairn
bet - balancing the freedom, growth happiness of individuals vs the org whole and the
imbalance of wealth and power in the org.  See counselling and divorce rates.  See Post
Office scandal in UK - suicides as refusal to admint or understand mistakes. software
literacy is accepting bugs as fact of life.
also see why are some movies just bad

its not there was not a "strategy"
(leia, redemptionnetc)
its day to day decisions made alignment failure
needed someone ahouting "crap" a lot
