Even shorter conclusion
-----------------------

COmputers are missing from the productivity statistics - because missing proper usage.
(electrification of factories)

A progrmmale company is what you get when you ask a developer to design a company
And what do you get when you design a society like that?
Dystopia and Utopia visions - police state and free state.
Software is eating the world - its not done yet.
But it is now "systemically important" and so will be regulated.
Software governance will play a part as the 13th Factor
From a western perspective, double down on what works - what has driven the past two hundred years.
Transparency, democracy (have another go in 4 years), 
- more democractic companies
- less exploitation (ie credit card rates as exloitation)
- trust built in - the greatest trust is in Science, and medicine.
  how to replicate medicoen trust is to replicate "first do no harm" - the wwelfare of individual patient is paramount at all times.  This is freaking hard.  Discuss smelleiss and the scottish surgeon.

- project management is dead. Programmable companies are programmable. They dont need project management they need software developemnet life cycles. THis is the real success of Agile.

- fractal management - reporting on your own perfoemance - digital foot print analysis
- this will lead to early MOOPS - how to improve maangerial ineter personal comms
- FInally the capabiliteis good enough to lead to consumer use and psychologucal agents

- governance and simple and transaprent
  laws and code
  
- how we run companies will start to leak into how we run socieity
  - Wardley maps
  - models of economy and "our own facts"
  - fake news is just the shake out of "own facts"
  - 

- software and politics again is governace and shared osmosis
- coaseian dieal firm size - and regulations needed to change it (ie anti-trust laws allowing co-ordination)

utlinayel - where have we moved the complexity - it is rare that we remove complexity - we have it in people process or technology - and where we choose to put it and manage it matters 


Brexit: trade agreements ante becoming more aligning regulations, aligning culture.  Iphone is basically starting it from the other side.

so the more our lives are represented in virtual the more we can measure it and so harmonise it - so it's about being aware of the importance and details of these dates - this is thus a good thing of brexit

This is a conclusion of Quotes

::

	Software Reliability Engineering (SRE) is what happens when
	you ask a developer to design an operations team.

Google is justifiably proud of its' SRE teams - developing their own
software to run the computers, data centres, networks and release
processes that their success stood on was the only way to work at
web-scale.  The concept of "DevOps" and "SRE" are now embedded in
the minds of modern managers, few will admit they fall short.

But another quote might help::

    We see the benefits of computers everywhere, at home, at work,
    except in the productivity statistics.
    -- Robert Solow
    (https://eml.berkeley.edu/~bhhall/e124/David90_dynamo.pdf)    


I have a simple argument - he is correct, not because software and
computers cannot help but because they are not well used.  It would be
like complaining that we see notepads and pencils everywhere, except
in the productivity statistics, but only to discover that most people
cannot read and write and are just carrying the notepads around
because they dont want to be left out.

So, if SRE is what we get when developers design an operations team::

   A Programmable Company is what you get when you ask a developer to
   design a company.

   But what do we get when we ask developers to design a whole society?


If you understand grammar, sentence structure, paragraphs, chapters,
character development and three-act story structure, you can write
a OK-ish novel about pretty much anything.

If you cannot read or write, have never heard of a character arc, and
your bonus depends on it, then the novel you write is likely to make
as much sense as the Kafka-esque companies most of us work in.

Its simple.  But very hard to change.

Isn't everthing "done" now?
===========================

No. Not at all.::

    Most people are online
    Most of the Money is not
    (Ben Evans)

Most if commerce, most of government, in Western world, let alone
globally, are not "digital".  They are not "programmable", or even
visible on the virtual world.  Vast amounts of activity is invisible
online, let alone enabling meaningful interaction with that activity.

THat is the challenge of programmable companies - making the virtual
still reach the world.


Double down on what works
--------------------------

Western liberal 

* Productivity Gains unrealised
* Benefits not embraced
* SME is what you get when you ask a develooer to design a Operations department

* Programmable company is what you get when you ask a developer to design
an entire company

* What do we get when we ask developers to design a whole society

- transparency, democracy, openness, empiricism, competition these are the things to double down on - they have worked in fits and starts for 150 years, and past 75. 

The economist Robert Solow once quipped that   It has been argued
 that this
is because we are missing the essential rearrangement

Two productivity arguments - we aren't inventing stuff or we don't
have demand side drivers in western world - that is we can outsource
to cheap labour (Foxconn and Apple make iPhones) If we see 70s then
people invested massively as labour price was skyrocketing - similar
to post world war 1 (immigration, death etc)

Only when we absorb all human capacity to modern levels or social
changes

I think this is right - but it needs a little deeper
explanation. Let's look at architects, project managers and
bricklayers

Also internet not changed as much as washing machine - we see the big
communications changes in telegraph. Internet is changing the consumer
(the out of work ways we spend our time)

But it is still hard to see it transforming the in work hours.  Web
technologies do appear everywhere - but this is a function of more
robots ready to build houses - if only the instruction were there.



We only need project managers because the architects were not precise
enough. So the replacement of the bricklayer will soon become the
replacemt of project manager - the great hollowing out.

But this cannot happen if a business is still the equivalent of a
blueprint - needing builders and somon to actually make it work.

Only a programmable company, can be designed like an architect designs
a building - and only at that point can we look at theory of firm. At
things trading on our behalf, at companies that can be formed - is
this insane? Maybe but that's never meant wrong.


I did have the whole internet printing press thing going.  But we need
to look deeper

Software is not seeing the productivity gains it should.  But why?

Firstly we are not software literate as companies Not seeing right
size nor right interfaces

Second we are of seeing marketplace of companies to enable right
sizing But we can define what it is - code as the definition of all


Productivity gains held back by company structure, lack of code at all
levels

Architecture paradox - what we see as companies are not all the
decisions and functions needed - we are not seeing
everything. Software literate company will raise to level of explicit
code eachnof those activities - it will be real architecture to build.

A programmable company is one where all its activities and decisions
are encoded. See Apple and its runbook.  When asking for a quote ""


What is a programmable company - where it's decision processes are
both encoded, and adjustable by internal (direct coding) and external
(customers choosing or not choosing to buy, take action)

As much of facebooks actions, it's resource allocation, are steered by
the mass actions of its user base. It is a vast AB test. Now inntheory
this is true of any company - if we stop buying diesel cars GM will
stop making them. But the feedback is so crude and so long term that
it has little effect.  But the programmable company has much finer
grained touch points and is more attuned to them. More ML means even
more attundedness


So programmable company has all of its activities and its decision
points in code (migration to infrastructure as code) and these nodes
are programmable by internal and external actions.  This assumes more
democracy in the internal decisions (explicitly excluding people is
harder. See the linux hierarchy ? Open discussion, Chinese parliament)

With more activity automated we will see both more effi envy and more
problems - serverless world is where companies have to rebuild their
factories to accommodate software, the grain of the internet

Amazon had to solve these internally and basically released it.

Putting everything into code is the only way forward - from routing to
deliveries to accounts the whole skeleton of companies will need to be
as defined by code as an AWS web server.

We are going to redesign that much


Architecture paradox But this leads to the architecture paradox - by
having a robot do the building there is a lot more upfront work
fromthe architect (coding)

Productivity conjecture
- we are missing the re-arrangement of work - that software literacy may be 

I reject utterly that now that every freaking adult on the planet can
communicate with every other that we are not seeing productivity gains
(mobile phone choosing best market for produce)

- biggest idea is the iPhone. We just are not seeing the productivity
  gains we expect forom the Internet. It is hard to credit that it is
  a bubble the whole world has bought. We are nearly at a stage where
  every adult human has online access of some form.  That matters
  deeply

What we are missing is the re-organisation of the factory similar to that of electrification

We are missing the dynamo. 





A point about Pikety
--------------------

* Pikety redux

  - Labour lost, capital won (the reaosn wages not  subject to suply demand)
  - the great hollowing out
  - literacy and automation
  - Snowden was also right - data and pollution 
  - snowden
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog
http://www.nsaplayset.org
- Whats happening in the world - a sense of perspective
* http://www.digitalattackmap.com/faq/
* also want, wars, trade, shipping, energy, employment, poverty, investment etc.* 
some kind of model / mapp for the whole world. where is the money flowing / going?


  That the record of software coming in to disrupt industry is good -
  it's hard to learn software.  As a company this book is about having
  software in your company DNA

A point about project management and democratic companies
---------------------------------------------------------

I am going to stick my neck out and go for it - companies will become
more democratic - we shall see more voting and consensus in the
workplace.  We will also see the end of deadlines as companies become
*event driven* - that is, instead of shouting "get to this point"
there will be more "we need to get here" and monitoring and
encouragement.


The problem is *always* at the top
----------------------------------

Most technical problems can be solved by changing the business environment.
If the security of a company is challenged because a top level executive refuses to follow
the security restrictions, then there is a clear choice betwene firing the Sales Director
or having security.  Only the Board can decide that, and once they do it must be clear.

Google is currently experiencing a similar issue over sexual harrassment.

Data publication




Fractal Management
------------------

How individuals and teams need to model, monitor, mentor.


- CI and repeatability
- reporting on functionality of running processes
- analysis of inputs, running, outputs
- reporting upwards and outwards
- marketing your code





security (secrets management & auth)
------------------------------------
-- user management / aithentication authorisation
-- FIDO


security (deployment / repeatability)
-------------------------------------


prod parallel
-------------
Modelling



-- plumbing







   


A point about Simplicity
========================


Our golden goal is to keep things simple.

Simple breaks in simple ways, simple is simple to extend and improve.

Its not that simple is *easy* - often it is the opposite of easy, or quick.

But simple wins out over time. Simple gives great ROI.

I throughly recommend listening to Rich Hickey on this subject (Link)

So please keep in mind - we aim for simple.  Even if our day to day
work pushes us to quick and easy and complicated.  We need to push
back.


Data Mangement  Philosophy
==========================

Data Publishing needs to be a business level function, providing
consistent accurate and timely data to the rest of the organisation is
a vital task.

Like Bezos, can only consume data that is published - and people only
publishbsokething they willing to support

"but i cannot get my job done if "... that's not the problem ... the
problem is clean data

it's like security - it's a priority or it is not.








.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] The linked essay is by Eric S Raymond and is almost two
   decades old, and lays out an important philosophical difference
   between how open source software gets developed (in a mad press of new
   things being tried out) and how cathedrals are built.  The cathedral
   builders have tried to learn from the bazaar, and concepts like Agile
   are helping (a bit) but building software in our modern day
   institutions is still frustrating.  As software eats the world, it
   will find politics and push back.


Leassons from Amazon
--------------------

Using SteveY's rant

we see
1. API SOA is the right way

2. lots to learn from amazon

3. that testing is an interesting apprpach - QA and unit tests lie on a
spectrum, and that have solid production monitoirng is effectively having solid testing.  I go for doctests and QA tests as the right balance - too much mocking is too much mucking about.  You seem to get concetpually the right level of breakdown. not the level for your testing tool.  Having more test code than actual code is *not* a positive.

4. also interesting view on coase - not merely size of pizza team, but
reuse of code as a metric of organisational cohesion - start up to spreadeagled.
Lots of companies have many ways to do same thing.  But there should be one right way to do it. Look at xkcd cartoon - 14 different standards.  A cohesive org has one common standard - by fiat or by discussion.  If an org is happy to allow many flowers to bloom to find the right way then frankly its a community not an atomic unit.



Kaizen vs Kaikaku
-----------------

Run the company vs change the company

Incremental change (AB testing) vs Radical change

WHy not SaaS
------------

BEcause I *should* be able to do:

::

   authenticate('mycompany')
   for employee in get_all_my_employees():
       if employee.isTimesheetComplete:
           approve_payroll(employee)
	   send_payment_to_bank(employee)
	   send_email_to_employee(employee, template="youarepaid")

Now, there is a lot of noise about IFTT and all the SaaS providers and
so on but - they are wrong.

The above is the *right* way.

It just is.  You know it is.


Operations
----------
Severity Levels
usually maps to customer impact

(Apologies to Abraham Lincoln)

* All of the people cannot use all of it, all of the time
* All of the people cannot use some of it, all of the time
* Some of the people cannot use all of it
* Some of the people cannot use some of it
* Some of our capacity or redundnacy is lost, but no people are affected
* Everything Else

Is like a DefCon - actual *action* is required and defined and taken
(ie customer support portal is updated, these people are notified.)

This is *still* a programmable company - only we did not programm it
to deal with this situation and so it needs to be worked *on* not *in*


Politics and software
----------------------

- new economics becoming clearer - the neo-liberal consensus seems agonisingly wrong in Africa and just misguided post 2008
Open source - oss4gov manifesto



I argue that we are seeing three trends coming together

- coaseian ideal firm size is shrinking. Look at Bank of America/google.  Challenger banks etc. Yes vast scale matters - but at a certain point all business transactions are entries in a shared ledger. Remind you of something.


I don't think we are there yet. Ledger technologies don't scale to the level we care about punlically. But internally we are there.  But so was email before internet - the big win for electrification was the dynamo. 

- faster feedback on customer likes - wants in tech firms. Killing lions, cutting through beiraicy (end of project managers) 
- most projects are co-ordination - but code is self co-ordinating - programmable company is a non-project company

A programmable company is one where the current decisions are encoded in software

So let's imagine we take a decision on a project - this must mean a chnage to something (else it's a rubbish decision) so we record 

- what was decided
- why it was decided
- how to judge its success

This is a series of commits / changes across the base - from change to monitoring system to commits on the codebase 


Summary

If you are not coding, start
If you are not replacing whole projects with code that checks if other code is doing what it's supposed to, do that
If you are not migrating to a serverless, run anywhere model (with server-led for some highly optimised areas) do that
If you are not using crypto-signed ledgers everywheee internally do that
If your companies actions, reactions and decisions are not in code, do that
If you cannot do what if analysis on your company's defining code, do that




Steam factories and the rise of electricity
Steam factories ran to a central Rythmn, a single shaft ran from the vast engine across the factory floor and cranks attached to it. Everyone worked to the engines ryhtmn, physically located along the shaft

Toyota quality cicrcle simply could not be invented.



Culture 
Ok it's not the dog whistle version here - genuinely

Discuss economic changes (ha join Chang) - the reworking of world economic theory from neon liberalism after 2008. It is highly likely to undergo changes in western world

Now the software that is written is ireducably connected to culture it came from- the liberal hippy anti government culture of Berkeley has had enourmous impact (beards and gpls)
What is impact of Indian and Chinese culture - hard to say from outside. Some ideas are possible - less regexs, 

But open gov is almost a democractod imperative
I push Oss4gov but I need it funded by right wing maniacs


Steven Soderburgh shots his films on iphones - he does camera and editing "two more conversations Indont need to have"

It's this speed of decision making and reduction in friction that programmable company aims to produce - but it runs up against bad decision making of start ups in ethics feee regulation free environment

Facebook and radio lab podcast
expand a lot
Centralising has lead to trying to moderate at billion people scale - this leads to facebook moderation currently at 16,000 people looking at a million flagged items a day

the trade off between better (western cultural) norms (!) and raising the floor and being able to deal with granularity 

It most reminds me of the rowntrees model village - where they tried to make perfect community
Which is nice but it did not work for everyone and it chafed a lot and eventually people moved out because they wanted different freedoms - 

walled garden is nice but if you cannot build on the garden and create your own house and community then ... you will eventually outgrow it

Problems with PageRank
----------------------

Facebook and youtube etc are aggregators - and a problem with Pagerank leads to a global feedback loop - that google (the essential search engine) assumes that a *domain* that has high quality in one location has high quality across the board.

So facebook.com/newyorktimes is seen as good content by google.  And then facebook.com/grotmoron gets that same level of google juice.

This means that if you want your web page to be found by google it is waaaay better to put it on facebook than on your own domain

this leads to positive feedback loop for aggregators and a negative one for the domain based internet (which is how it is designed)

but this is a flawed google (search engine) view - in other words facebook is assumed to be guaranteeing quality of all its content - which effectively makes it a publisher (the big radiolab discussion on moderation at scale)

so some form of regulation for search engine seems sensible - ie something in robots.txt that tells you the site structure and site governance (ie this bit we publish, this bit is platform


Software Socialist
------------------

We live in utopian socialist society
VC funding is just ensuring nice middle class life not threatens when trying to build company

But point of (most) companies is not wealth creation (!) - Facebook just took ad revenue from Fifth Avenue
Amazon just moves sales from Walmart to amazon

But the organisational changes needed to achieve this are profound and deep - building amazon was an amazing acheieneltnt - and it is in the organisational format that government follows - government invests stem for long term wealth creation (new forms tech) and business takes that invention and innovates new product forms and new organisational forms to distribute the created wealth (or rather wealth only creates when it is distributed)

As such my predilection got expenreinifn with governance forms in organisations - why Debian is a bigger idea than its distbuttion


social media - it turns out that social media was actually public publishing - (Zuckerbetgs pivot to person to person messaging) - and that newspapers were curators of publishing - journalism was about deciding what gets putinot oublic sphere.  

democratic journalism is important - social media was a way of allowing people to publish something important  (mexico drug wars) or crap (influencers) - somehow we need good ways to find facts and raise them to consciousness - a backlog of issues and a store of facts

GOvernance
----------

As software eats the world it becomes part of the world - and so becomes *regulated*.
Software regulation is now just *politics* - its hard, complicated and needs
compromise and being infomred and active.


We start with a utopia - the CLuetrain manifesto.
And we start looking at privacy (ie secure / closed)
Governance of software starts to become part of the process of SDLC
Risks and controls is an essential part of any applications services - 13th factor in 12 fctor apps

Governance and territotries and culture and events
--------------------------------------------------

If we can build products tailered to exact personal preferences, we
can also tailor products to countries laws and regulations.

The question is how much should we? How much is use of Whatsapp or
twitter a driver of social change (just as bicycles, trains, love
letters in postal service and Sears selling to american blacks).  It
becomes a question of choosing your balknisations?

Facebook newsfeed - just another media channel?  Filter bubble - not
as bubble as it used to be? (research) Behviour targetted ads vs
context targetted ads - howo well is duck duck go doing?  Fake News -
there has *always* been fake news. its just we were not listening to
every stupid pub conversation.

NYTimes::

Two months before the 1990 P.G.A. Championship at Shoal Creek and six years after the club hosted the 1984 P.G.A., Mr. Thompson responded to a question from a reporter for The Birmingham Post-Herald about Shoal Creek’s membership, which included Jews and women, by saying, "We don’t discriminate in every other area except blacks."

https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/29/sports/golf/29thompson.html

Yeah. We used to only see this shot if it made it into the NYTimes - now it's everywhere.  This is good because the amazing stuff is everywhere, it's just that the diamonds in river of shit metaphor still
leaves a river of shot. one day they will learn - this is cultural colonisation that white men complain about.  







Opportunities - MOOP, agent moderated life, what about an app that
says "hey, you know that comment your friend just made about Flat
Earth. Majority of scientific opinion accepts earth is a sphere
floating in space - here is a photo".  Or "You know your father just
said Gays and Faggots will burn in Hell, here is ... well you get the
point"

Imagine not merely access to all the world's knowledge, but access
mediated by a Medical-level ethically driven moderation.

But what if it is not ethically driven? How do we know what is being told to us?
This should itself be extractable.

Look at graduates of today - well adjusted renaissance people with little desire / experience to kill maim.

Was this how we imagined the future in 1800? No - yet we are what changed more than the world - we could not take the 1750 mindset into a car / modern world - it's not a question  of technical skills - it's about character and attitude 

it's basically why putin cannot take his country further - it's the reason the drunk cannot crawl out of the bottle.

It's about choice. 

Keanau would know 



Science funding and support
----------------------------

Are we seeing drop off in support for science and technology? Well, poets don't tend to compose eulogies for scientists buried in st. paul's very much like Newton? (maybe hawking?)

We are seeing explanation exponent change

what makes rocket ships go up - funding makes rockets go up - no bucks no buck rogers.

Funding comes from support - which comes from understanding why the next step counts - this is education

I am doing important experiments for kids and Inam 500 years behind !!

education funding comes first 

Statistical socialist
---------------------
I am a statistical socialist - i believe that every human being born in the planet is born within a narrow normal distribution for all of their attributes - intelligence, height, weight, good looks and sexual size (!) - and where their life outcomes are greater than the range of their distribution i believe those outcomes are influenced more by structural and systemic factors, and then by their character 


Rise (return) of curation
--------------------------
Death of the newsfeed 
https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/4/2/the-death-of-the-newsfeed
Newsfeed is going as facebook signals peer to peer focus (snapshot stories taking their toll)
But this implies rise again of journalism - who do i follow which leads to newspapers with opinions - but at least they are open accountable opinions (cf murdoch scandals)

It's going to be around picking out sample bias really really well

Seems to me to create multiple models using random selections of same training sets and then see if models come up with similar answers - can build statistical models around that.

find a statistician??? 

Predistribution
---------------

Roberto Unger - changing the market structure of it is unfair so that redistribution is not always swimming up stream

"A billionaire is an example of market failure" (me)

Progressive politics seems to be engaged in harm reduction for their opponents 

Brexit
------
The big takeaway here is the constraining of executive powers on international scene - Uvettee cooper oliver lwtwin bill - seen in congress refusing to ratify treaties with dubbya - this is greater recognition of gloablisation - not just trade between boundaries but with services and regulation a merging and porous nature of boundaries  - and a search for legislative approval - a search for democratic approval against executive power - truly reflecting the new power balance infra companies

what are the changes coming? micro and macro - nuclear war with korea or opioid crisis, prison crises

maybe software can help us identify and follow up on the small the micro, the forgotten

Poker lessons for life
http://m.nautil.us/issue/55/trust/the-resulting-fallacy-is-ruining-your-decisions

given a fair coin we can know the probability of heads to .5, but we cannot know the next outcome.  so we can place bets on 2/1 but we should not let the outcome upset us

software enables us to more consistently run the process (think software in finance) and increase our throughout this increasing chances of total number of heads 


brexit and regulatory alignment 
there is a presumption that regulatory distinctiveness is beneficial - that we would offer something special

it's hard to imagine what - we all want iphones and advanced composite materials or biotech medicine - and the benefits of common open protocols in those areas are manifest, and the obvious adavantages of being a new different  one are minimal

using Amazon queu services
Not the GP author, but he's talking about using 4 different AWS services in a particular architectural pattern. SNS topics give you a triggering mechanism to start the long running task. Step Functions give you light-weight flow control and state management, but don't directly perform any interesting work. Instead, the step function steps can invoke Lambda functions or jobs in Elastic Container Service to do the actual work. When they finish, the step function can move on to the next step or retry things as needed

Digital Advertising and the NSA 

this is "getting carried away with data"

It stopped being advertising some time ago (ad vert - latin /old drench make aware of)

the issue of "everything is insider trading" or SEC as regulator of
last resort)
