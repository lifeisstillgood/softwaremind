==================================
How to think about software issues
==================================

These are shorter discussions - but valuable, in trying to frame what
is and is not important in a new software literate, programmable
company.

Distributed computing and Big Data
==================================

(see that migration from x to storing data around the servers)

Cloud and DevOps
================

Distributed computing is great.
What is less great is the failures increase.
The promise is totally failure free - but reality is failures occur and need to
be managed.

DevOps, especially the "indiana jones crossing the street" style, is
vital - and it tends to look like massive amounts of moniotring and
logging with tiny amount of simple distributed code.

The base concepts here are simple and easy.

But only on massive scale can the nearly-downtime free be found - so either you rely on a provider to do it (ie AWS) or you need to group as industries to supply this service (possible developemnt0

Dilbert
=======
problem is in not only is dilberts boss an idiot but so is his boss - in Scott Adams words "It's turtles all the way up"

but I don't believe that

People don't act the way they do because they are idiots - they act because of available skills and a system of incentives

and changing the fundamental skill (literacy) changes the set of incentives (a programmable company is something you can use)

Permission to get a little obsessed
===================================

It's about being better than our yesterday selves
https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/cool-tools/id605920446?i=1000440253165

it's about taking the time to better us so that we are a better example to our kids - time and something to impart

go be yourself - just like Indid

it's why process matters, why finding the essence matters - why mise en place matters - why not pretending you know what the plan is.

The solution to corporate world - GAR - when is solving this green when amber and when red. 

And solve the hardest parts first - and the hardest part is usually the rope bridge - all the way across the busies s value


Paxos and brexit and journalism
--------------------------------

One of our changes is that it's so much harder to be sure what has been agreed - consensus is often accepting what "everyone else" agrees - but finding our what everyone thinks used to be the job of the journalist, (reporting) but now social
media has made it so hard to find commonality

this goes into expert problem - when experts agree they have a mechanism to agree - medical trials / p values 

but that flies in face of common sense - unlearned by science

we all become scientists? but then we just have same problem of not investigating it sufficiently 

we have mass movement (climate change)
approach - enough david attenborough docs and it wins

still
leaves negotiating for the actual action
