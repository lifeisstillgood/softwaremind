My friend, Jefferson's an American saint because he wrote the words, "All men are created
equal." Words he clearly didn't believe, since he allowed his own children to live in
slavery. He was a rich wine snob who was sick of paying taxes to the Brits. So yeah, he
wrote some lovely words and aroused the rabble, and they went out and died for those
words, while he sat back and drank his wine and f***ed his slave girl. This guy wants to
tell me we're living in a community. Don't make me laugh. I'm living in America, and in
America, you're on your own. America's not a country. It's just a business. Now f***ing
pay me.

There are many people gocing thier work for benefit of others
(vaxxers), and foss is amoung this.

business is the froth on top, the dostribution
once we enter the regukated zone, the utilities, the criminal activity, wven the onsoder
trading laws,
then we stoo being red in tooth and claw and we see proft not

"business" can be either a parasite onnsociwty or a driver to greater heights.
its not terribly clear which so we need to be clver and see balance in public and provate

My thinking on this is trying to evolve but it’s something like

- no software provider commercial or otherwise provides warranty. Microsoft Office is “as
is” whoever you are. Some companies are big enough to get to be at the table where the
roadmap is discussed but few.

- so the issue is not liability as in “we can sue you”. It’s liability as in “provide a
fix for this (now!!!)”.

- the provider of the fix does not have to be the original developer who provides the fix

- this leaves open a possibility of ecosystems of developers in similar areas
Able to cross-work


- but if we have a world where everyone can write (maybe not well) then all code can be
“locally artisnally produced”

- so what is the great value of the big tech giants?


Buying a specific new software for a new need - thats work for hire. Liability can be done
but also payment upfront

Using software “just left lying around”. Well yeah. It can have vulnerabilities. But boy,
compare that to the shitshownif Fox News tried to write its own web server to publish its
own stuff.

wrotignis natires way of ahowing howmlazy out rhingming is

software is gods way of ahowing how imprecise our writing is

software sharpens communication - removes all greyness
and somforces is to agree or dosagree not fudge

will make politiclamproblems worse or will rise this e 


products and protocols can be global 
(smartphones, teslas) but council by-laws
construction permits and solar panel land use
are - but thise can be more powerful

aligning that (ala EU) is our next societal challenge
(i mean thatvmeans ending war) 

Globalisation means harmonisation
---------------------------------

New sensors allow new data industries
--------------------------------------
The ad twrgetting industry is just one
Most people are judging the value they get from smarphones,
amaozn delivieries and music back car alogies are worth the loss
of privacy.  they are mostly right because the consequences
of privaxy loss are lomited mostly to being served adverts.

the other feared consequences - loss of medical
cover, rediced access to financial services, insurance 
reduction and so on, are either heavily refulated
and bu fiat all people must bear the insurance cost (flooding a common exmaple)
or thise consequences are not widespread 


But we need to consider imapcts 

Others:

- roads will become the most heaviky monitored and 
imaged parts of human built areas - globally accurate milimetre perfect 
mapping of urban areas will be available. 
and extneding out from that is a matter of photo-grammetry.
At some point conveyancing will be transformed - i remeber a weeks delay in my forst house purchase 
when there was a half inch dosrepancy in council road plans 
twenty years apart.  I was less concerned about half an inch till it was pointed out that 
i might find my self unable to cross fromnthe public highway to mynown drivewaybwithout crossing a half inchnof someone elses land

it all was sorted out but any Tesla dricingndown the road would have mapped the keeb precisely
and kept photos.  

Is that Teslas property? is is a community service? 

See peruvian real eatate laws 

sensors make common areas introspectable 

"arrnage the world so it can be iterated over"


crypto solving wrong problem:
banks solving scale problem - 
but crypto can solve that by tracking movement of
money more efdectively in ledger

but crypto sovokg wrong problem - its not moving money but 
being abke to rescind chnage alter mistakes and dosagreements 

banks should be human scale so the problems resolved more easily
but also algorithmic to aboid biases

beat the market
---------------

if market is eceryone, you cant beat the market without taking from everyone
onky valye is better resource allocatuon in prodyctive assets 

The corproate form is not social
--------
servility is asking for permission onnhow to associate
many cororpates exepct us to ask permasion

There is not a software supply chain,
it is a found things agglomeration

we are not paying for FOSS -

in my head yes it is noce to fox this but this presents a fundamental challenge to
*capitalism*
or whatever the modern day thing is.

i have worked for foss but i have not done as much as Inwould like because inlike feeding
my kids more than inlike coding and Inlike coding a lot

security
--------
We talk about mechanisation of military (cavalry -> oil based transport)
also mechanisationnof society

but we need to talk about cyber security of society
see drones and area radio deniability (drones and remote control)

just as each radio must have encruotion and frwquency cycling
and somehow keep that going day after day so every radio has it
ie that old transport plane needs upgrading

so must we donsame for hardware supply chain
and software supply chain

and look at ransomare - that has social implicatiosn and the answer is basically upgrading
tech
- and there will be w freerider benefot
