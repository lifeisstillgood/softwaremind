coders are the new managers
---------------------------

THe new workers are the CPUs. The supervisors and instructions come from the coders - and code is the design.  Look at difference between maangers in Drucker - bestriding the world making decisions, and managers in Googles eight rules - coaches helping keep the employees happy.  And what if employees are not happy - look at OpenAI where an emploee revolt removed the board.  We shall come back to employee ower later. WHy did rome collapse? Collapse of trust and trade.

management is dead - 
coders are new managers 
management is simple (peter principle) 
management can be automated - to raise floor level

modelling 
mentoring 
monitoring
politicking  (financier and project choosing) 
project / activity choice - resource allocation is mostly what *change* to apply - which is mostly a datwining process of project survival - so financing is process of finding successful projects not initiating successful projects
or finding obvious failings and initiating blessed solutions 

management training matters but 
is that training in coaching (google 8 rules) or training in project initiation and selection or training in political alignment 


i hvave sympathy woth the control freaks because there is no standrdisatikn - no process (military word??)
there is need for soijg things this way my
way - commot formats and so on

management is basically xonsrant on job training of others 
- linting humans
