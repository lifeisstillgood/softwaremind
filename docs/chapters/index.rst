The Software Literate Company
=============================

<Guidance notes to vanish from index as fleshed out>
* Software literacy, the challenges faced
* programmable company
* coase based sizes, remote workers, productivity, regulatory
  alignment and remote workers
* impact of open ness and democracy on decision making and trust of
  products ->
* test cases like Knight Capital

I have worked, and still do work in some of the world's leading
corporations, or most vibrant startups. And they have almost unifromly
been staffed by talented, driven and intelligent

But the talent, drive and intelligence has always had problems
translating into the actions of the organisation, even to the extent
of closing doors.

Yet when we write code we expect the decisions made in that code to
translate into definiteve action by the computer.  Why is there such a
disconnect?

The opportunity and the problem are the same thing - a programmable
company will do what it is told, not have internal debates.  And that
is going to lead to amazing productivity benefits. and terrifying
consequences.

(start with productivity debate, move to assumption about
electrification and software. We are expecting to replace the 23M USA
"office and process support workers" with a lot of perl scripts.  But
we need to do 3 things first

* actually define what we want done (80% and 98%) - architecture and
  software
* define a process to agree what we want done (policies - they will be
  readable)
* deifne process to report those to the rest of the world - regulators
  or branding, being a black box will be insufficnet to be trusted.
  And Our APIs become 'testable' - you will not hide their actions.

<Image of fish with clear head.>  

That is the coming transformation of the corporation. Greed will lead
them there, but they must take on the mantle of governance, else we
will not trust them.

Also communication to co-ordination to collaboration.  Software and internet
have easily enabled the first.  And the productivity benefits surely must exist.
But co-ordination - thats going to be huge. and seen in strange new areas.

The Software Literate Society
=============================

<Guidance notes to vanish from index as fleshed out>

* governance problem - how to decide about car crashes
  Market
  Regulation
  Discussion
* privacy problem - PII data, European GDPR
* Algorithms and us

Common solution is more openness,
Lets all laugh at commercially confidential as a phrase

Death of Rent seeking and Crypto Currencies
The more Ra-Ra end of the Cryptocurrency, bouyed it must be said by buying
bitcoin at 5 cents and flogging around 14 grand, think that the new infrastructure,
digitally native it being laid down.  The basic idea is why should companies like twiter or
facebook cpature so much of the value of what is social interaction.

This is a Libertarian take on much of what I argue elsewhere in the book, and
frankly its better than nothing.  There are significnat problems with bitcoin,
but the openness of the blockchain ledger has many exciting possibilities.

Also taking back control - Moops and Fathers
