    "Software is eating the world".
    Marc Andreessen


As software eats the world it needs to deal with the world's decisions

Software is a new form of *literacy*.  Just imagine
what literacy did to every walk of human life as it spread. The world
of Medieval Monks in Scriptoreums had embedded in it newspapers, bus
timetables, ballot papers and user manuals, but you try predicting
that from a bunch of itchy, bald-headed guys holding feathers.  

It is this books assertion that *Software Literacy* in the 21st
Century is as deep and as profound as reading and writing was in the
15th, and will have impacts as long-lasting on the human race
(assuming we all make it that far.).  And some people get it - and
some people don't.  So this book is an attempt to try and persuade
some of the don't side that this really is important.

Main Themes of the Book
------------------------

We are going to cover a lot of ground - after all if Software really is eating the world,
we need to cover it all.  But luckily there are Themes that are emerging across the Globe
that not only highlught the shape of the problems, but show the shape of the solutions
being attempted as well.

Ultimately this is a optimistic book, so dont worry.


Engineering problems
  Writing large-scale software that works is, frankly, hard.  It is a very complex engineering
  problem, and there are emerging consensus' on the right ways (or perhaps the wrong ways).  We
  look at some case studies like Target and Knight Capital

Governance Problems
  Very closely related to engineering problems, are governance problems.
  In large code bases there are 2 kinds of governance problem - making sure that the code
  base adheres to its quality standards, for example regression testing, style checking and
  other 'audit' processes.
  And another, more common idea of governance, of how do we make the decisions on what
  software to write, and what policies to place in the software.

  Lets look at car travel. Already I find it hard to drive without a
  SatNav, but at what point is that application solely for my benefit.
  What happens when I speed down a lane - should the app report me?
  And what of road usage pricing - can I get the option for the pricey
  but quick route and the slow but cheap route?

  Additionally as we penetrate software deeper into our lives we hit problem
  that todays software engineers are all to familiar with, indeed as
  are lawyers, civil servants and busisness folk that when we try to
  express what seems simple in our heads, or simple when spoken out loud
  has far more complexities that were not obvious before we started.

  Software surfaces trade offs explicitly The moral issues over canoes
  and crocodiles

  
  I first heard this from the COmmentator Ben evans but I am sure it
  has been elsewhere but Lets imagine a putative self driving car,
  travelling down the road when a group of children, hand in hand, run
  out in front. A humans reaction speeds would be insufficient, but
  this is AI. This car can react fast enough, but the physics of the
  situation still mean even if it brakes the car will hit and kill the
  frozen children.  But there is another option, one that is available
  at the speeds of nano-second's thought. To turn and plough the car, and you
  the 'driver' into the nearby bridge support, instantly killing you but saving the lives
  of the children.

  Now how would you tell the software engineer to code that? If the
  driver was your next-door neighbour? Would you choose to buy a car
  that could choose to kill you in favour of others?

  What if there is a right to customisation - an Open Source right to
  tinker with code. Thats something I think is a deep and vital
  principle of our new Software literate wolrd.  But Should that code
  be allowed on the road? What if some of the Open Source commits
  modified it to only swerve for WHite children not Black?  What if
  the car fails to recognise Black Children as human (see the AI
  chapter)

  Modern Democracy hides an awful lot of complexity across an awful
  lot of areas - but the minute we try to encode our decisions in
  software we need to be awfully painfully precise.  I have spent a
  career creating software, and the biggest problems are always the
  disconnect between dofferent peoples understanding of the same
  situation.
  
  And dont think that AI will magically make the decisions for us, stopping us having these
  difficult discussions as a society.
  
  
  This issue of Fractal Complexity I call this the "Fed up with
  Experts Trap" after UK politician Micahel Gove.

  This will I feel lead to the professionalisation of many areas of the SOftware industry -
  very similar perhaps to Railways, Aerospace or other SAfety-critical industries.  At a certain
  level the software, the process for making the software, and the people doing it are signed off
  by one "Chief Engineer", whose name and reputation is on the line.  They won't move fast and break things.  Sometimes, like in VW, they will fail themselves.

  Where are the lines drawn? Uber has not been prosecuted for regulaory floating
  But VW has. So there is always a boundary set - look at Elser / Groening.
  

Government Problems
  One of the biggest themes is that as more and more of our lives move "online" or become
  "digital", then we take more and more of our expectations for how "society should be" online.
  For exmaple, no-one wants paedophiles to be trawling the YouTube-Kids comments sections,
  but YouTube found it was not policing the process well enough.

  Companies that look insanely profitable now, are going to find they
  need to perform the policing and governmental roles that we expect (or perhaps have those roles
  ceded to outside regulatory agencies.).  The vast open prasiries that Apple, Google and Facebook
  enjoy now, are not going to remain open for ever.

  The political problems of today are reflected in the structure of
  This is exacerbated by the global nature of technology - I have the
  same iPhone here as my compatriot in Mumbai or GuangDong.  And so we
  will need the same wifi standards, the same GSM standards, and
  slowly we get the same Taxi from the same Uber app, or the same
  social media and voting and ... its called regulatory convergence.
  And just as companies will suffer from ability for employeees to
  move, countries will too.

  Software is shaped like the org that build it, or it shapes the organisation.
  Why I think we democracies should write lots of government software.

Summary

- we shall live online, at least partially. So we shall need to take governments with us.
- good engineering makes us all better and safer
- this stems from a desire to do it right 
- and a conducive political environment  (or at least a clear and consistent one)
- teams, companies will all chnage
- democracy is still young - and we need to help it grow,
- look in my works yes mighty and despair
