Tranisation from managers to coders 
reduces ability for non technical management 
to know what is possible and how to implement next step on phase soace

management is becoming less abke to *dirext* 
and more able to *prevent* - old saw of government having engine of lawnmower and brakes of rolls royce

leadership - saying its ok (sniper and injured enemy)

with rmeote working either everyone is told about everything
or there is total loss of cohesion - either write it all down and lose political power or 



coders are the new managers
---------------------------

THe new workers are the CPUs. The supervisors and instructions come from the coders - and code is the design.  Look at difference between maangers in Drucker - bestriding the world making decisions, and managers in Googles eight rules - coaches helping keep the employees happy.  And what if employees are not happy - look at OpenAI where an emploee revolt removed the board.  We shall come back to employee ower later. WHy did rome collapse? Collapse of trust and trade.

management is dead - 
coders are new managers 
management is simple (peter principle) 
management can be automated - to raise floor level

modelling 
mentoring 
monitoring
politicking  (financier and project choosing) 
project / activity choice - resource allocation is mostly what *change* to apply - which is mostly a datwining process of project survival - so financing is process of finding successful projects not initiating successful projects
or finding obvious failings and initiating blessed solutions 

management training matters but 
is that training in coaching (google 8 rules) or training in project initiation and selection or training in political alignment 


i hvave sympathy woth the control freaks because there is no standrdisatikn - no process (military word??)
there is need for soijg things this way my
way - commot formats and so on

management is basically xonsrant on job training of others 
- linting humans 

we live lives of imperfection and pretend every is fine and the dodson are between the two is our stress level - but admitting the truth is a way to find calm and time to fix the imperfections
