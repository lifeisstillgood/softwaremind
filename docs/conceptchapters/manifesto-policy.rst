This is a sort of summary - a view on what policies we should be seeing, and an attempt to start a conversation


Open Source and in-skillin

It seems clear that some hardware chips capabilities are too starategic to leave to a global market 

This is a prescient article on lack of skills in network telecoms.  Some recommendations are simple

- focus on automation 
- use of standard open source hardware - with a view to develop regional hardware manufacturing skills
- Use of open source in strategic areas. Allows competitive growth and improvement whilst allowing pool of talent to be large and growing

- double down on democracy :
Individual rights matter

- Transperncy and open in software

- see gov.uk - uk Census 


Change it or lose it principle
--------------------

Thing the right don't get is climate change is not about taking your freedoms - it's about trying to preserve as many as we can -

similar principle is why we need to raise retirement age to 70 and then make sure everyone eats well abs exercises after fifty

(basically it's either a nanny state or the politician that helps millions of people look better and get laid more often will get re-elected)) 


So I am trying to work out the basics of climate change action needed

1. More efficient agriculture 
Cutting and clearing land for agriculture is generally destructive - so a) everyone becomes vegetarian, b) 
stop growing food in 2 dimensions c) grow more efficient food 
(broth and hydroponics)

2. more efficient transport of food
Don't transport food thousands of miles, 
don't refrigerate it, don't fly it, 

3. transport to move off carbon
Stop flying, more EV. 

4. reduce travel 
apart from flights and holidays (carbon tax) 
commuting is huge contributor- remote working will impact this

4. Building efficiency 
Insulation and ground source heat pumps and so on
