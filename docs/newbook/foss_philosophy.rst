My friend, Jefferson's an American saint because he wrote the words, "All men are created equal." Words he clearly didn't believe, since he allowed his own children to live in slavery. He was a rich wine snob who was sick of paying taxes to the Brits. So yeah, he wrote some lovely words and aroused the rabble, and they went out and died for those words, while he sat back and drank his wine and f***ed his slave girl. This guy wants to tell me we're living in a community. Don't make me laugh. I'm living in America, and in America, you're on your own. America's not a country. It's just a business. Now f***ing pay me.

There are many people gocing thier work for benefit of others
(vaxxers), and foss is amoung this. 

business is the froth on top, the dostribution 
once we enter the regukated zone, the utilities, the criminal activity, wven the onsoder trading laws,
then we stoo being red in tooth and claw and we see proft not 

"business" can be either a parasite onnsociwty or a driver to greater heights.
its not terribly clear which so we need to be clver and see balance in public and provate work

My thinking on this is trying to evolve but it’s something like

- no software provider commercial or otherwise provides warranty. Microsoft Office is “as is” whoever you are. Some companies are big enough to get to be at the table where the roadmap is discussed but few.

- so the issue is not liability as in “we can sue you”. It’s liability as in “provide a fix for this (now!!!)”.

- the provider of the fix does not have to be the original developer who provides the fix

- this leaves open a possibility of ecosystems of developers in similar areas 
Able to cross-work 


- but if we have a world where everyone can write (maybe not well) then all code can be “locally artisnally produced”

- so what is the great value of the big tech giants?


Buying a specific new software for a new need - thats work for hire. Liability can be done but also payment upfront

Using software “just left lying around”. Well yeah. It can have vulnerabilities. But boy, compare that to the shitshownif Fox News tried to write its own web server to publish its own stuff.
