The Totalitarian Bet, The democratic bet and wealth taxes
=================================================================
* totalitarian bet
  
lo-code is rubbish but learnign curve huge
developer tools are really litersacy tools
software will not only control the companies we work in (policy enforcement snd impenetaiotn) but will shape how we cahnge said policies - through democracy and
through modelling - policits exists but will shift to more open and more model driven.
We hope - thsts the totalitarian bet

chapter:Feudalism, Democracy, Wealth Tax
========================================

* democracy in companyes as orgnsityiona change
  Why should those employees control those - but they already do, itâ€™s just internal politics, bribery 

politics will not end, but democracy will change politics of elite in and out of orgs

Jp Morgan was a democratising force just like FDR using the mass of people to push aside old feudal elites (and make new ones natch)



Chapter: MMT, Crypto, Equality, Democracy
=========================================

class war: https://billmitchell.org/blog/?p=61635
chapter - MMT, class war, wealth tax, crypto
my take is MMt is right about basics
that itnis about abolity tonput reaources if a nation / society to bear 
Notth korea has one approach
the state droven is another (soviet)
Capitalism is another - elite driven
but democracy is another 
democracy and capitalism are not synonymous 

dutch in 1700s used financial methods to align 
resources - as did banknof england

its leas clear where and how thise resources can be directed 
financially - esp when much finance is derivative
or betting on other outcomes instead of focused on 
using resources

how do we use resources - fiat crypto will likely end 
banks ability to create money sonwill affect ability for koneybcrwation to reflect 
real reaiurces

so what will? whomwill dorect more nurses 

- equality and infrastructure  is the issue. if we were all equal, all capital holders, all labour and all consumers 
then infrasturcutre would drive agglomeration - or rather itnwould be easier to move cities due to 
climate chnage - or would it - the built environment?

We have 150 years apart two scandals of adukterated milk
One killing 8000, one killing 4.  the difference? Ability if people 
to koin together to monitor to agitate - something like communication 

without something? 


From guy in guardian. Essence is that China is betting that it can control its citizens using monitoring and social pressure.  Now worth talking about racist assumptions - china has a hugely strong culture of familial devotion and respect built in, so this is not like trying to monitor norweigans or Montana. 
       But it is also a totalitarian regieme using reeducaton camps against racial minority. SO its not nice.
       The problem is two fold. 
       1. This is how society does work.
       2. But its how society decides what is acceptble, what is to be pubished and what not.
       3. this is culture wars.  Is it ok for gay marriage.  My 7yo daughter knows most of the words to Katy Perrys; I kissed a girl (cherry chopsticks!) 

       It will work in reducing open dissent. But will it work in actaually changing minds.
