themes
- how does software fit into society
what are the changes coming? micro and macro - nuclear war with korea or opioid crisis, prison crises

maybe software can help us identify and follow up on the small the micro, the forgotten

the promise of moop 

software must be part of democratic institutions and support the effectiveness of those institutions

lessons from moore's law
just keeping the growth rate high has cost economists (see freakonmocs) has increased 25 food since 1965 - just to maintain growth rate

this is an example of cost of r&d

safety critical and time/budget/market driven

interestingly this is the regulation driven world too - 


weird working shifts - just in time manufacturing demanded just in time labour costs - shifting the risk from corporation to labour force 

it's a choice !!! 


- eff is arguing tweets are free speech and if government publish information through them then they cannot block people

this is huge - mega huge. it's implications run outrageously deep and completely fuck most social media business models. nice

this is part of the ultimate utility-ideation of anything we find socially useful - roads to electricity

and it has implications on the kind of software development approach needed too (reliable vs agile) 

Poker lessons for life
http://m.nautil.us/issue/55/trust/the-resulting-fallacy-is-ruining-your-decisions

given a fair coin we can know the probability of heads to .5, but we cannot know the next outcome.  so we can place bets on 2/1 but we should not let the outcome upset us

focus on the process, so the outcomes eventually fall our way - it's a process of building a house advantage 

software enables us to more consistently run the process (think software in finance) and increase our throughout this increasing chances of total number of heads 


brexit and regulatory alignment 
there is a presumption that regulatory distinctiveness is beneficial - that we would offer something special

it's hard to imagine what - we all want iphones and advanced composite materials or biotech medicine - and the benefits of common open protocols in those areas are manifest, and the obvious adavantages of being a new different  one are minimal

using Amazon queu services
Not the GP author, but he's talking about using 4 different AWS services in a particular architectural pattern. SNS topics give you a triggering mechanism to start the long running task. Step Functions give you light-weight flow control and state management, but don't directly perform any interesting work. Instead, the step function steps can invoke Lambda functions or jobs in Elastic Container Service to do the actual work. When they finish, the step function can move on to the next step or retry things as needed

don't aim for perfect - aim for above average and lots of opportunity to improve

Major fault lines no longer left vs right (social vs ?) but open v closed and default the same rules / regs and default different rules regs (see brexit / federalism) 


The new organisational form



Digital Advertising and the NSA 

this is "getting carried away with data"

It stopped being advertising some time ago (ad vert - latin /old drench make aware of)

This is an best and informative role -  rand awareness etc. yes it was inefficient but the ability to serve a different t advert to every person aka cambridge analytics is  it advertising - it's something else - behaviour driven point of sale prompting 

So i hate those supermarkets that put little sweets in front of the checkout  - you, CEO of asda, have just decided to make me disappoint my child and guard tee i say no five times - for and extra few pence if prom then if i cave - and oh yes dental cares and liver dies

But not this fucking rack of sweets can follow me around my whole digitisl life, shuffling sweets with lawnmower parts, new shirts and so on.  nothing I want nothing laid out for me in an informative or curated way  - just random shit

And this is Poor Tech. it is possible to curate the products of the world - to add age then in their use to me, to analyse my digital behaviour and drop a twenty second video explaining why the Park would be a great day out, suggest a list of sandwich fillings available on offer at tesco and remind my facebook group that the weather is not taking and i will be there about 13:00

That's the sort of useful stuff we want

the rest of the crap you can keep 


- advertising is just slow subscriptions sent to someone else
