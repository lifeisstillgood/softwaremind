This is a issue of *public order*.  If some idiot stands on a street corner and performs an anti-social act (varies based on jurisdiction, location, weather, gender, who is likely to be watching) then a state actor (the local beat cop) takes some action.

If they do the same in a pub / bar then the bar owner takes some action, with the implicit or explicit help of same state actor earlier.

If a printer / publisher receives an anti-social act in writing (hmm, harder to imagine but ok.  Holocaust denial in Berlin ? 

Now we move to an online location - a platform.

Look this must be pretty obvious surely? 

actually no - defining what is anti-social is hard and almost impossible to move globally.  we will probably see balkanisation based around language first.  which will lean heavily on jurisdiction

 

Philosophy 
Marx defines production as important part of industrial society

what is software society going to be defined through - being on time as a worker is unlikely to remain as a necessary behaviour

what else is going to change? (delver into marx suoerstructure)
