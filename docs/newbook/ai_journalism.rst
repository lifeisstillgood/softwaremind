Challenges of training data and bias
We started with 'easy' problems - facial recgnition and black african
descent. Oh look Stanford has white male phd students.
Bias in Generative AI: show me images of nazi stormtroopers.
Hang on. Why are there chinese or black african stomrtroopers?? Huh
Look at how skin cacner detection - is there a ruler in the image? Is the
image taken under flouresent light ?

- there is *almost certainly* child porn in training data. That bothers me
  enormously.
- But what about 

Fixing it. "publish your training data". Thats a *positive* move, but, "hey we
trained on these 5 billion images. What do you do with those? How do you even
classifiy them?

CV scanning. Anecodatally a large corporation decides to use AI to scan CVs,
and identify young people most likely to succeed in the corporation. It is given
the CVs of everyone in the company, and gets to work. It flatout rejects every
CV from a woman. They remove the gender from the CVs - it still does it.
They dig in - why is this going to be rejected. Basically, women reach a certain
point in the company, and rise no higher. Therefore women wont succeed at this
company.  Now what? It is correctly analysing the problem. Its not the answer
you want.

But it is a part of the democractic bet - AI is not fooled by the double-think
bias humans introduce to be able to survive.  Any totaltitarian regieme has that
in it.  But only an egalitarian democracy has the ability to change to make
itself truly equal.

Do we want to do that? THose who will obviously gain say yes. THose who will
lose, and what of those who will lose big? Shall we introduce a wealth tax?


World building matters (ability to plan is basically
ability to predict future. THis is a hall mark of intelligence - also why
people with bad internal models make poor decisions, and why its so hard to
get people with vastly differing models to understand each otehr - used to be
limited to crime. now... politics?  Its why its vital to edicate people to have
same model at first, its also why edication laevels make biggest
differentiator in politics, and also why choosing the first model makes your
'side' more relevant. See north korean education camps. But also see how
many people did nto believe societ model but kept stum'

Any how - world building - effective model - how 

LLM - conceptually similar to knearest neighbour
and word2vec 


Journalism and the training data 
————

timeline is the problem - sympathy for facebook because 
how dontounorgnaise timeline ? cannot show eveything - cannot shownjust friends because broing
so whats the algorithm
? ask a go ernment they dont say just say "dont destroy democeacy"
but perhaps problem is "timeline" - dont do timeline do education or agent with best interet s of the user 

training data matters
---------------------
Google and pagerank soon became google and returned tonhomepage data as feedback onnquality
Tesla owns data on when the car braked or jerked or gas applied and 
can record that and upload it nightly and use for modelling
journlism is societies way of marking training data
textbooks are way of marking trianong data 
science is way to doscover correct weights for feedback

now why is it that google keeps
my clicks or my steering as ots own proprietary data

health data - it shoukd be public data 
by default

licensing or otherwise but not unavailable
