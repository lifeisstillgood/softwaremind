Sanity Summary
—————————————-

* Software is a form of literacy

Literacy is fundamentally Explicit, Introspectable and tends towards Open

The next few decades or more will belong to software literate the way the past few belonged to those who could read and write.  

* policy, process, control

  implements process
  enforces policy
  Is instantly introspectable
  Careful issues around deep state
  



* software is disaggeegating management 

  - THoery of firm / how organisations will change
  - Coders are the new managers, CPUs are the new workers (as almost every job has co-pilot or enabled by software / robot / machine)
  
* LLMs, AI, journalism
  Training data matters 

* totalitarian bet
  
* democracy in companyes as orgnsityiona change
  Why should those employees control those - but they already do, it’s just internal politics, bribery 

politics will not end, but democracy will change politics of elite in and out of orgs

Jp Morgan was a democratising force just like FDR using the mass of people to push aside old feudal elites (and make new ones natch)

* 2 orders magnitude conjecture - that forms will divide up like this ??  
 - The Economist presents a simplified model of every issue.  But it is possible that every prod-parallel env can supply a model (ie the model that SEC holds fed every minute about traders) 
 
* conclusion



Disaggreagtio of management 
—————————
But software is dofferent because the 
Coders are managers now or rather CPUs are weoners

the things management existed for (communicatio 
between grouos of workers) nonlonger matters once the 
code is working 

A better test rig is orders magnitude more effective than “better communication”
Once a complete prod-parallel environment exists, any management question is answerable directly through exploratory code chnage.

Major chnages (1.x 2.x) can presumably use the same real life feed, see Tesla data advantage.

see Brooks law.

that management is disaggregated and the communication 
value is much much lower 


also primary skill set is learning 
that is the provle we have is one we have never seen before
in this configuretion
so gonaway learn prqxtise and then come back and fix
its not a 9-5 job - its a consuktancy 
so the idea of agile or management or bums on seats is ... off - end of industrialisation (see my favourite door in London, and the need for knowledge workers, like lawyers)


Other management issues
model monitor mentor, internal homestasis of org, whilst meeting external 
needs - politics of status quo and guesstimate changes.

If the communication is gone, if model monitor are better done by software, of process is better done by software, then what we have left is internal homeostasis
Or politics (which will be disrupted by democracy as feudal politics was disrupted - and its the middle class that rebel always)

Mentoring becomes a profession - a profession that is impossible to hold back to a few
It’s a fiat chance that we will find lawyer like prosfessions where they will have a commit bit for the big software - laws, the software for gov depts

What will it look like?
Newsroom of WaPo- managers become editors as it becomes possible to manage a company through code 




Totalitarian Bet
————————
lo-code is rubbish but learnign curve huge
developer tools are really litersacy tools
software will not only control the companies we work in (policy enforcement snd impenetaiotn) but will shape how we cahnge said policies - through democracy and
through modelling - policits exists but will shift to more open and more model driven.
We hope - thsts the totalitarian bet




AI and journalism 
-------------------

Challenges of training data and bias
We started with 'easy' problems - facial recgnition and black african
descent. Oh look Stanford has white male phd students.
Bias in Generative AI: show me images of nazi stormtroopers.
Hang on. Why are there chinese or black african stomrtroopers?? Huh
Look at how skin cacner detection - is there a ruler in the image? Is the
image taken under flouresent light ?

- there is *almost certainly* child porn in training data. That bothers me
  enormously.
- But what about 

Fixing it. "publish your training data". Thats a *positive* move, but, "hey we
trained on these 5 billion images. What do you do with those? How do you even
classifiy them?

CV scanning. Anecodatally a large corporation decides to use AI to scan CVs,
and identify young people most likely to succeed in the corporation. It is given
the CVs of everyone in the company, and gets to work. It flatout rejects every
CV from a woman. They remove the gender from the CVs - it still does it.
They dig in - why is this going to be rejected. Basically, women reach a certain
point in the company, and rise no higher. Therefore women wont succeed at this
company.  Now what? It is correctly analysing the problem. Its not the answer
you want.

But it is a part of the democractic bet - AI is not fooled by the double-think
bias humans introduce to be able to survive.  Any totaltitarian regieme has that
in it.  But only an egalitarian democracy has the ability to change to make
itself truly equal.

Do we want to do that? THose who will obviously gain say yes. THose who will
lose, and what of those who will lose big? Shall we introduce a wealth tax?


World building matters (ability to plan is basically
ability to predict future. THis is a hall mark of intelligence - also why
people with bad internal models make poor decisions, and why its so hard to
get people with vastly differing models to understand each otehr - used to be
limited to crime. now... politics?  Its why its vital to edicate people to have
same model at first, its also why edication laevels make biggest
differentiator in politics, and also why choosing the first model makes your
'side' more relevant. See north korean education camps. But also see how
many people did nto believe societ model but kept stum'

Any how - world building - effective model - how 

LLM - conceptually similar to knearest neighbour
and word2vec 


Journalism and the training data 
————

timeline is the problem - sympathy for facebook because 
how dontounorgnaise timeline ? cannot show eveything - cannot shownjust friends because broing
so whats the algorithm
? ask a go ernment they dont say just say "dont destroy democeacy"
but perhaps problem is "timeline" - dont do timeline do education or agent with best interet s of the user 

Org chnage
—————————-

Institutions sustain *themselves* or rather the jobs of the controlling minds of the institution.  Today’s Catholic Church would be viewed by its founders as some kind of uber-hippy bunch of democratic maniacs out to destroy civilisation.

I think the difference here is we can view a company / institution as a machine to do a job, and between a company that has a controlling mind able to change its own machine “code” hence chnage its job.

Without software the two things are needed - but with software we can concieve of a programmable company that just does its tasks as assigned for as long as inputs occur.  If those tasks involve say sending jobs out to gig workers the idea kind of works

It does mean you could build a Death Star using robots in place of gig workers (which is the obvious multi-generational solution)

But it does imply something about our companies - that once the whole company can be specified in code, splitting off the “controlling minds” bit (ie management, plus developers) into seperate location seems interesting

It also explicitly makes the issue of who decides what chnages and how come to the fore

training data matters
---------------------
Google and pagerank soon became google and returned tonhomepage data as feedback onnquality
Tesla owns data on when the car braked or jerked or gas applied and 
can record that and upload it nightly and use for modelling
journlism is societies way of marking training data
textbooks are way of marking trianong data 
science is way to doscover correct weights for feedback

now why is it that google keeps
my clicks or my steering as ots own proprietary data

health data - it shoukd be public data 
by default

licensing or otherwise but not unavailable




security
--------
We talk about mechanisation of military (cavalry -> oil based transport)
also mechanisationnof society

but we need to talk about cyber security of society
see drones and area radio deniability (drones and remote control)

just as each radio must have encruotion and frwquency cycling 
and somehow keep that going day after day so every radio has it
ie that old transport plane needs upgrading

so must we donsame for hardware supply chain 
and software supply chain

and look at ransomare - that has social implicatiosn and the answer is basically upgrading tech
- and there will be w freerider benefot 



Software is a form of literacy
-------------------------

Software as form of loteracy
Also a encodingnof the policies and
processes of the organisation that created it
Software guides, does crimes, but most importantlyit is explicit

this means all organisational polcoes are explict and doscvoerable and 
this opens orgnaiations in ways inimaginable before

having all policies directly connected to realmworld enabkes 
faster feedback, modelling etc

but it comes at cost of openness

we kight win 

this is a doscsussio. 



Software as a form of literacy, a way of taising 
the political into the explicit

testable organisation - External to team is owned automateabke testing milestones -> probably fitness style or cucumber style but the point is some form of policy that is enforced by engine 

In fact that’s everything Inthink - software is literacy expressing policy implementation- that is this is how this org thinks


Agile fails because the ret of the org is not buying intonit 
- obvious answer is no deadlines till its all deadlines

but how do we change the rest if the org - we subsume it into software
so that becomes gove us the milestones
and we build a new org that is software depenandt (thisnis software wating the world

and this new org is repacing the old (its inecitable£
mbut demands defining the policy of the org in software terms (see do crime for VW)

thats how to buikd teating regience

but once do that you have a model and can speed up chnage

testable organisation
wxplicit policies
programmable policies 
modellable and predicatable company
iteration speed 


its not science or even engineering 
its literate expression of human organisation
or a written executable process (lets call it 90%)



We are reshaping the world by making it explict, introspectable, open.
[expand on explicit (written down), introspectable (not low-code), open(totalitarian bet)]

There are enormous implications.  Similarly in history we have chosen to become
urban dwellers, agricutrlists,and now knowledge workers and organisers at scale

Arranging the world to be iterated over.
----------------------------------------

  (joke about google destroying what it cannot index) BUt this is also true -
  we did lose pre-industrial society.
  Lessons about how to live togetehr were lost (beware rose coloured glasses and abuse)
  Historical sweep important, industrial world only 250 years old, (1776 story).
  We have lost freedoms and gained a new world - but it is unstoppable. We live in unsustainable
  world and our only hope is onwards.  Software helps organise at scale - but *trust* matters.
  Organise at scale, but organise openly to encourage trust, esp when it gets difficult.
  Yes the system is rigged (Trump debate, darkness by design, but mortgage redlines and martgage credit ratings, the need to type in "do crime" in VW code).  Software is the system, so you can read the rules.  If the rules are "chinese communist party is in charge" then its harder, but humans value fairness beyond almost all (monkey experiment)

Journalism as training data for society
--------------------------------------- 

LLM as representation of "our" culture (see where western culture came from - 1776)
  Journlism as training data for LLMS - but by extension training data for our culture.#
  Google search is being repalced by LLMs. WHo controls the LLM access, which training corpus is used, which fine tuning. this matters. But only as a snapshot into "normcore".
  But it is the representation of our culture - and it fits on a laptop.
  Texas textbooks - what we teach our young, what is our culture, these matter 
  See mickey mouse and solar system.  POV is worth 80 IQ points.  By not giving kids the right PoVfrom the start we dont prevent them discovering for them selves - we just make it harder.

* Autism and rules
  software can represent, enfource, encourage, discover, speed up rules.
  But rules that are written dwn threaten priviledge
  This antognism will be paramount for future.  Piketty - can we beat him down?
  Can we over come priviledge? SEC approach - legistlate priviledge into being good. But leave them enough to make it worth thier while? THreat of digital currency. The example of cryptocurrency as why we have regulatioon and crime (see Sherlock holmes stories about bank failures)

autism and rukes
- fristrationnof bureaucracy and lack of what rukes and where to look
it empowers thise innpower, but rikes take away power and priviledge 

software is operationalmrules - the advantages outweigh cost of openness
esp when closed approach goves priviledge

improving organistions
----------------------

  COders are new managers
  Management - model, monitor, mentor, maintain. Mgmt is being disaggregated.
  Maintainence of org is in two parts - cultural (our values) - Post office scandal for pathology.
  Also maintenacne of large orgs as theory of firm - both contracting cost and treasury. Shared treasury is oncredibly valuable - see smoothed cashflows in corporate world.
  Two orders - do the work or cause it to be done or provide funding - where do they shade into each other.  They do this within orgs - how projects are really done, constanct hustle for new things.
  Mgmt as economist articles. But if software encoding is more detailed? THis si where LLMs replace mgmt - by being able to simulae and predict more effectively than manabement.

modern feudalism -> giving bonuses 
and budgets to those who support the CEO is clearest 
example of (Iron law bureaucrats)
democracy tends to defeat that asbribimg everyone temfs often 
to mean taking the cou
tse benfit everyone (see theory of EU inestment 
and voting spain not bote for knights of hungary)





management by shouting at underlings is 
a search for systems to deal with problems
that just occured. maybe effocectoce but there clearlywill
be better ways - but not in a tourney 

Organising at scale
-------------------

  But we do need to identify the problem, identify a solution, do the solution.
  Nudges wont work.  Its too short a time scale to do it thorugh education

organisation - just gove cash to local communities
isnt that similar argument to just employ people and let them 

But openly modelling, providing literate solutions so people can read what and
why they are guided.

This will help.
But not everyone

But toll is mental health issues that manifest in a urban buttoned down world.
But we have been given less freedom

JOurnalism
-----------

  Journalism is the training data for society - see weights and lawsuit from New York Times
  Also see LLms are search across our societies knowledge (and cultural norms)

  How has google search been replaced - by LLM

  But what is was trained on matters - we need to see the “canon” and try to
  avoid the SEO poisoning of the well - that LLM training data and weights
  likely to be determined by government as it is likely to be the teaching
  assistant for future 

  And we want to define that in same way we define the textbooks 



Software is disaggregating management 
--------------------------------------

so what does mgmt do and what is software edisrupting

mgmt - model monotor mentor but mostly ensure continuation of org
when mission conflixts with org survival have pathologies

devmanual - tech lead as director of movie - setting stnadrds and color charts 

management - you do the work or you cause it to be done ... in your taste
workers do the work like canermen or set builders
the director ensures it is done to his or her taste. their colour oallette their speed and clarity
their ability to ensure others understand their taste ensures the outcome will be coherent

anything above this, anything that does not affect taste is finance

the banker might talk loudly about how he made the film possibke and the notes he gave - but thats crap
its just money

what we need is to understand where the lines are deawn 

Most managemers esp at fonance level have "economist pundit" levelnof understanding
not wrong but not testabke either

a software model however is testsble - and a virtual model of the business is onenofnthe most valuabke items we willmoriduce
