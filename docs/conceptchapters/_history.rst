80s as rise of open source and 90s rise of PC, and internet, 'a PC on every dsktop' to iPhone a supercomputer in every pocket.

Next step is agents working on our behalf - needing improved security, meaning of privacy and abiity to view review it ourselves and self programming - open and programmable.  And to move beyond the individual to programming the group, the company, the society.

Intro
-----
I believe that software is best seen as a new form of literacy, and so it has two competing aims - to be able to run as billions of binary instructions on a CPU, and also to be comprehesible to human minds.  I am incapable of performing billions of binary calculations per second, but on a daily basis my collegues and I share software between each other and are able to reason about the outcomes of the software and the bugs we have inevitably added and diverted us from the true purpose of coffee drinking.

So Software has two compilers to target - (trained) human minds, and the hardware inside every Motherboard.  The English you are reading has only one compiler to target my brain and your brain - the (trained) human mind.

How we got there is the story of geniuses and mortals, war, organisational guerillas, and a faith that openness and transparency will triumph.


Alan Turing and the road to Software 
------------------------------------

Alan Mathison Turing was 27 years old when he walked through the gates of Bletchly Park, the UK Governments Code and Cipher School (GCCS), just a day after the declartion of War by the UK on Germany. 

There is a lovely scene in the 2014 biopic of Turing's life `The Imitation Game` where Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing is having an interview with Charles Dance as 'The Establishment Figure', deciding if Turing should be allowed to work at Bletchly.  Charles Dance's character is pompous and throughout the film provides most of the 'oppostion' to Turing.  Of course we need exposition to explain Turings already astounding genius and where the UK is in the war, but we set up a dynamic here that probably oversells the 'lone genius struggling against a world that does not understand him'.

While I love any film I can persuade my kids to watch that teaches even a passing resemblance to history ("look its him from Avengers"), when he walked into Bletchly Park, Turing had already been working with the UK government and Polish Intelligence in their attempts to break Nazi Ciphers for over a year.

Yes there were difficulties getting sufficient resources to build the bombe, that cracking the Enigma code was always a struggle, but a struggle not against pompous ADmirals, but against mathematics itself. A letter to Churchill solved most of the resource problems, but the enemy remained building a machine to take on nature.  

(worth dicussing the home chain radar, bletchly as examples of what UK was supremely good at - organisation on massive Stae scale. Something the spark travelled to USA with).


Turing built electronic machines (crib - a plaintext we can assume is in the cipher. As such we can eleimnate many positions (the not ciphering to oneself). Then the bombe is used to try all positions possible to get letter E to D and z to R If some of those positions collide we eliinate those, and so on and so on.)

Turig forsaw software as solution to thinking

I am still sticking with my "software as a form of literacy" concept.  But just as literacy was not possible without some form of mark-making technology (from clay and stick, to ink and pulp) literacy itself "transcends" the technology, but cannot exist without it - a virtual and real life split perhaps.


Different technologies drive different computing capabiities, which drives the software literacy tropes / genres we use to represent the new capabilities.

Yes we could all write assembler or even binary, and you know, people did. But we could all count by marking one line after another till we reached our age, but instead symbols encapsulate greater and greter higher level interpretations.

A story.
Databases waited for the technology to move from tapes to random access disks. Then we could get random access to any chunk of data enabling a new way of laying out data physically allowing for new ways to query and then SQL 
 

I think this is analsous to science fiction writing.
Shakespeare used fairies because aliens were not a well understood concept to his audience.  And rembmer tha software is both expressing ententions to a computer / compiler, it is also (equally? More so?) expressing intentions to the human reader (who needs to agree or understand and partner with the work)

We lave Alan with his Apple. (stephen Fry comment)
He foresaw a self modifying machine - and built one. The spark had fled to the USA (politics, Von Braun, organisation, british decline).  But software is a language that had to speak to the computer on how to modify itself but also be understood by the humans.  And at this level of sophistication, humans were mostly understanding at single 1:1 mapping of instructions.  It is as if we counted by making one line on a clay tablet for each addition, instead of using 5 or 7 as symbols.  The next step is to design a language that is short, concise, compact for humans, but *expands* into machin language.



John Backus and the road to Fortran
-------
- Organisation and subversion 
- The development of in redibly sophisiticated weaponry (radar, cavity magnetron, nuclear fission, jet turbines, proximity fuse (Tizzard mission)

all needed computing power to go firther model more


The next step is general computing. Maths is fine and fundamental, but how do we expand outside of maths, how do we share the time on the commputer, how do we build a level of software abstraction that looks after the resources, does the administration of the computer hardware, but does so using the computer, and does so in a way that does not interfere with new growth new needs.  How to we have an operatiing system.

UNIX

Editor for mortals
Baked into and starting to eat the world - see rows of accountants and replacing them - films stills of tony hancock and then maggie smith film

Unix leads to common operating system 

How do we unleash the millions of people who want to build for themselves. How do we find the best wayt to build software together.

Linux and the socialism of software 
----------------------
Open, sophisticated but rough, best sevelopemnt practises 

Open in social orgbaisation - the issues of toxic relationships and better solutions

Co-ordination, decision making, large scale software and large scale capitalism.  The challenge of the organisation.  Linux was incredible. Is it the right approach? Failed GUI choices. 

Microsoft, WYSIWIG and dead ends
------------------------
Its not software - low code and no code. Cutting out marvel comic panels and rearrnaging them. It works to an extent and great practitioners can oroduce something *fast*. But it is more like a DJ remixing. There is nothing wrong per se, there is a need for a busines to just get onwoth it.  But from the stand point of a fully literate society, remixing Panels from Marvel comics is missong the point (and dont get me started on the legal issues of trying to add in panels from DC comics!)
