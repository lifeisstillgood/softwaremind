====================
The Totalitarian Bet
====================


Totalitarian bet is also a bet 
on democracy (or western modern democracy)

but what are the biggest trends that made 1921>1945 special?

* biggest by far is energy (oil) - ie biggesy reaource pump
* pikkety blip - far and away most sognficiat reaource allocation issue
* impact of mass education 
* impact of mass communication (broadcast and peer to peer)

so i am going to do some Turchin style predictions here 

Energy is over. we have to handle the climate change
 (its not going to be reversed, its going to be mitigation, mass movement)

Mass education is here to stay, we are even getting to school
leaving age 21

mass communication here to stay

so what is going to chnage western democracues ?
reaource allocation - the reversion to kean of uber wealthy holding all wealth
but wealthy will face the thrash back of 


also - as infrastructre becomes balkanised
we see increased spend on maintenance but also changes jow 
architecture and town olanning work - more checksums, more ledgers and more centrakised / democtatic / legal control iver ledgers and lefger changes

less darkness by design - because risk of politibsl control we dont agrre with - eu vs usa disagreements will allow for eu market approach

Democractic Bet
---------------

That openness leads to better outcomes. Studies on agile in orgs. Military behaviour.
                           Democarcy is waaay newer than we think. And I think tied heavily to scientic method.

All the big wind have gone 
- steam coal electricity electronics, medicine and public health
still huge stirdes neede but what we need now is consolidation of the wins not tremendous growth

democracy, equality and openness - to srave off r> i

beware of viewing geopolicis as a civilisationalmclash - most civilisations want the beat for citizens (and elite)

tickets are not the best / right way to forward plan -> see moving work from team to team in devops handbook

the work is creative not operational

(i mean operational is fine but that means  you just have not automated it yet) 

leadership as form of terrorism or protection racket - I could blow up your whole company create toxic cultures - but I won't so please pay me
