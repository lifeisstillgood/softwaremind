Introduction
============

software therapy / mentorship 
outside org structure 



Software as form of loteracy
Also a encodingnof the policies and
processes of the organisation that created it
Software guides, does crimes, but most importantlyit is explicit

this means all organisational polcoes are explict and doscvoerable and 
this opens orgnaiations in ways inimaginable before

having all policies directly connected to realmworld enabkes 
faster feedback, modelling etc

but it comes at cost of openness

we kight win 

this is a doscsussio. 



Software as a form of literacy, a way of taising 
the political into the explicit

testable organisation - External to team is owned automateabke testing milestones -> probably fitness style or cucumber style but the point is some form of policy that is enforced by engine 

In fact that’s everything Inthink - software is literacy expressing policy implementation- that is this is how this org thinks


Agile fails because the ret of the org is not buying intonit 
- obvious answer is no deadlines till its all deadlines

but how do we change the rest if the org - we subsume it into software
so that becomes gove us the milestones
and we build a new org that is software depenandt (thisnis software wating the world

and this new org is repacing the old (its inecitable£
mbut demands defining the policy of the org in software terms (see do crime for VW)

thats how to buikd teating regience

but once do that you have a model and can speed up chnage

testable organisation
wxplicit policies
programmable policies 
modellable and predicatable company
iteration speed 




Sanity Summary
--------------

10 points - rest goes in next book

* Software is form of literacy
* THoery of firm / how organisations will change
* software is disaggeegating management 
* LLMs, AI, journalism, 
* totalitarian bet
* democracy in companyes as orgnsityiona change
* rules, autism, nerds, 
* politics will not end, but democracy will change politics of elite in and out of orgs
* 2 orders magnitude, who understands, and why economist undersanding will be replaced with model
* 


Software is a form of literacy
-------------------------------
[expand]

its not science or even engineering 
its literate expression of human organisation
or a written executable process (lets call it 90%)



We are reshaping the world by making it explict, introspectable, open.
[expand on explicit (written down), introspectable (not low-code), open(totalitarian bet)]

There are enormous implications.  Similarly in history we have chosen to become
urban dwellers, agricutrlists,and now knowledge workers and organisers at scale

Arranging the world to be iterated over.
----------------------------------------

  (joke about google destroying what it cannot index) BUt this is also true -
  we did lose pre-industrial society.
  Lessons about how to live togetehr were lost (beware rose coloured glasses and abuse)
  Historical sweep important, industrial world only 250 years old, (1776 story).
  We have lost freedoms and gained a new world - but it is unstoppable. We live in unsustainable
  world and our only hope is onwards.  Software helps organise at scale - but *trust* matters.
  Organise at scale, but organise openly to encourage trust, esp when it gets difficult.
  Yes the system is rigged (Trump debate, darkness by design, but mortgage redlines and martgage credit ratings, the need to type in "do crime" in VW code).  Software is the system, so you can read the rules.  If the rules are "chinese communist party is in charge" then its harder, but humans value fairness beyond almost all (monkey experiment)

Journalism as training data for society
--------------------------------------- 

LLM as representation of "our" culture (see where western culture came from - 1776)
  Journlism as training data for LLMS - but by extension training data for our culture.#
  Google search is being repalced by LLMs. WHo controls the LLM access, which training corpus is used, which fine tuning. this matters. But only as a snapshot into "normcore".
  But it is the representation of our culture - and it fits on a laptop.
  Texas textbooks - what we teach our young, what is our culture, these matter 
  See mickey mouse and solar system.  POV is worth 80 IQ points.  By not giving kids the right PoVfrom the start we dont prevent them discovering for them selves - we just make it harder.

* Autism and rules
  software can represent, enfource, encourage, discover, speed up rules.
  But rules that are written dwn threaten priviledge
  This antognism will be paramount for future.  Piketty - can we beat him down?
  Can we over come priviledge? SEC approach - legistlate priviledge into being good. But leave them enough to make it worth thier while? THreat of digital currency. The example of cryptocurrency as why we have regulatioon and crime (see Sherlock holmes stories about bank failures)

autism and rukes
- fristrationnof bureaucracy and lack of what rukes and where to look
it empowers thise innpower, but rikes take away power and priviledge 

software is operationalmrules - the advantages outweigh cost of openness
esp when closed approach goves priviledge

improving organistions
----------------------

  COders are new managers
  Management - model, monitor, mentor, maintain. Mgmt is being disaggregated.
  Maintainence of org is in two parts - cultural (our values) - Post office scandal for pathology.
  Also maintenacne of large orgs as theory of firm - both contracting cost and treasury. Shared treasury is oncredibly valuable - see smoothed cashflows in corporate world.
  Two orders - do the work or cause it to be done or provide funding - where do they shade into each other.  They do this within orgs - how projects are really done, constanct hustle for new things.
  Mgmt as economist articles. But if software encoding is more detailed? THis si where LLMs replace mgmt - by being able to simulae and predict more effectively than manabement.

Organising at scale
-------------------

  But we do need to identify the problem, identify a solution, do the solution.
  Nudges wont work.  Its too short a time scale to do it thorugh education

organisation - just gove cash to local communities
isnt that similar argument to just employ people and let them 

But openly modelling, providing literate solutions so people can read what and
why they are guided.

This will help.
But not everyone

But toll is mental health issues that manifest in a urban buttoned down world.
But we have been given less freedom

JOurnalism
-----------

  Journalism is the training data for society - see weights and lawsuit from New York Times
  Also see LLms are search across our societies knowledge (and cultural norms)

  How has google search been replaced - by LLM

  But what is was trained on matters - we need to see the “canon” and try to
  avoid the SEO poisoning of the well - that LLM training data and weights
  likely to be determined by government as it is likely to be the teaching
  assistant for future 

  And we want to define that in same way we define the textbooks 



Software is disaggregating management 
--------------------------------------

so what does mgmt do and what is software edisrupting

mgmt - model monotor mentor but mostly ensure continuation of org
when mission conflixts with org survival have pathologies

devmanual - tech lead as director of movie - setting stnadrds and color charts 

management - you do the work or you cause it to be done ... in your taste
workers do the work like canermen or set builders
the director ensures it is done to his or her taste. their colour oallette their speed and clarity
their ability to ensure others understand their taste ensures the outcome will be coherent

anything above this, anything that does not affect taste is finance

the banker might talk loudly about how he made the film possibke and the notes he gave - but thats crap
its just money

what we need is to understand where the lines are deawn 

Most managemers esp at fonance level have "economist pundit" levelnof understanding
not wrong but not testabke either

a software model however is testsble - and a virtual model of the business is onenofnthe most valuabke items we willmoriduce
