The SDLC - Literate Best Practise / The DevManual
=================================================

Many pieces combine to make modern SDLC - see Joels 12 rules. Policy as code. Software givernance matters - see trolley problems, voting on PRs and VW scandal. End of commerical confidentiality.

Chapter: Literary Best practise
===============================
Software demands different best practises
We are finding them - and what it will look like makes WaPo different to a
medieval scriptoreum.
Prod-Parallel and back testing, 
Tool use
COmmon solutions (octavio, editing)
THis is The DevManual

To "manage" you need to have an OODA loop.
To "release with confidence" you need to have a prod-parallel env / test rig.
To "plan" you need to have failing tests in the prod-parallel env, that are like
bug bounties for employees.  DO not fall for capitalism here, use socialism
inside the org.

Chapter OODA loop and production ready, tech debt.
==================================================

Observe, Orientate, Decide, Act.

This is operating *on* an existing system. We are managing the system.
If we cannot get metrics from the system, we cannot observe
If we do not have a (software) model of the system we cannot orientate,
(use of Statitical process control)
Deciding is politics - persuasion, allocation of resources, collection of
resources.  
Act is development 

The main issue is we have *assumed* the model is in the managers head, or 
in their holy spreadsheet.  Possibly because the numbers in the sheet are
'dangerous' to pass around.

But with software metrics, thats a choice not a requirement. A model can be 
"soft real time" updated, and the VAR number calculated each day.

Deciding is affected to, as differnet costly options can be appplied to model
and prod-parallel for analysis.  

And Act is the art of filling in the red failing tests in the prod-parallel.
