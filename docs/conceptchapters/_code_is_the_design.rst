The essence boils down to 'when you have cod the final design is done. there is no lernative extra work done. it is mechanical determinism from that point.  so anything before writing code is just artists drawings..

>>> Designing software is an exercise in managing complexity. The complexity exists within the software design itself, within the software organization of the company, and within the industry as a whole.

Robot built house - impact on architects

Inherent comploexity, organisation complexity, standards complexity 


Implications: it is cheaper and sinpler to build it and test than almost anything else 

He completely forseea and argues for the agile approach (better defijing the waterfall as eachbstage frozen before next)  

it also shows the isea of QA (quality analysis) as wrong headed - QA uses certain standards to reject one of the many widgets rolling off the lien as substandard - but aoftware rolls off and is an exact copy each time.  whats there it QA? 

This is just testing - and there is no point manually testing (other than a Mumbai jobs program) but there is value on designing upfrotn testinf
