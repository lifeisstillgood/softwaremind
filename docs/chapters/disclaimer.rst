I am pretty sure that I am not an original thinker.  At least I find
that when I have a thought that is original to me, I later on find out
others have also had similar ideas.  But the second and third-order effects,
and the cumulative effect of all this, gives us new insights. And that's what can be valuable - actionable insights.

So as I meander through the worlds of tech, politics and philosophy,
forgive me for insufficent citations.
