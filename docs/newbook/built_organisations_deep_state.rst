Built Organisations, Deep State
================================

Organisations are *built* for certain purposes. The infrastructure forces a certain capability - its hard to make a tank force trasnform to an air force without major capital investment.  But they also have the Slow AI built in - they *think* in certain ways.  Deep State (pace the fake news spin) is where it is hard to change the processes that you do not know about.

Institutions sustain *themselves* or rather the jobs of the controlling minds of the institution.  Today’s Catholic Church would be viewed by its founders as some kind of uber-hippy bunch of democratic maniacs out to destroy civilisation.

I think the difference here is we can view a company / institution as a machine to do a job, and between a company that has a controlling mind able to change its own machine “code” hence chnage its job.

Without software the two things are needed - but with software we can concieve of a programmable company that just does its tasks as assigned for as long as inputs occur.  If those tasks involve say sending jobs out to gig workers the idea kind of works

It does mean you could build a Death Star using robots in place of gig workers (which is the obvious multi-generational solution)

But it does imply something about our companies - that once the whole company can be specified in code, splitting off the “controlling minds” bit (ie management, plus developers) into seperate location seems interesting

It also explicitly makes the issue of who decides what chnages and how come to the fore
