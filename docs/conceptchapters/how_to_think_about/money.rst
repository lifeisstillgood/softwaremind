So if we look at Domestic private (households and factories etc) - they can spend a certain amount and recive (salary, revenue) a certain amount. That might be a psotive balance (more salary than expensese) or negative but it is a balance somewhere

Same for government - spending and taxation.

And same for trade we sell
more goods then we buy or not

So if youbare workshop of the worlde you can run a trade surplus (more coming in) and then the other two parts (private and government) can "save" (invest in infrastruxture)
