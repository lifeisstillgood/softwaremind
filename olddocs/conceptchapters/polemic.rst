Online anonymity

There Are No Accidents. By Jessie Singer. Simon & Schuster; 352 pages; $27.99

A look at why Americans are so much more likely to suffer violent "accidents" than people in other rich countries. The author shows how poor road design, rather than bad driving, explains the persistence of car crashes and how factories use rule books and disciplinary procedures as a cheap substitute for real safety improvements.

Machines do the majority of     the work - look at finance.

So people who organise / arrnage the workers are the coders - so what are the managers of the coders doing? 

this is where shit jobs come from - there are people who 
dont code and just blah 

We havr a society that works, but we can explore better ways 


I doubt the town square ever existed as an idealised thing - social underclasses would always have struggled to even be allowed into the square, it would have been commercially dominated and social success would have correlated wrongly to commercial and political success.

Luckily we get to design the rules for our society and town squares and so improve access.  In my view most of the so called "social justice wars" are to do with how far to the front shoukd one push previously excluded underclasses.

More and more I think we need proof of being human to participate in the "town square". It essentially means the end of anonimity online, but I struggle to see how we overcome bots without it.

which means - software is a more effective means to define the suoer orgnaism - we are making the rules surfaced and transparent
