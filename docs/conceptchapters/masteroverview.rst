Editor Notes
============

I am aiming to build the following *argument*

* Software is a new form of Literacy.  [intro, to cabinet office, then hey this is not enough]

* Literacy is a human reaction to a new form of technology - just as
literacy was for writing (Jericho had walls before humans had writing)

* Software is eating the world - but what does that mean?
What about software is meanginfully different?

- programmability.

- modelling & monitoring. A company, even a person or society, can be
  seen as a deterministic(?) set of instructions.  The policy can be
  expressly codified and written.  We would think that is good for
  say, a financial exchange.

- it means programmability - information travels "instantly" (no more
  middle mgmt)

- opennness by defualt (try having laws that no one is allowed to
  read)

- it means change is atomic and explicit - you can read what the
  expected behaviour is under different conditions.

- if you put humans in the loop (to keep decision making flexibility,
  you lose speed and feedback and modelling )

- trolley problems. most important implication is more and more Trolley problems

  Prediction: There will become a class of security researcher not
  focused on software bug bounties, but trolley problem misalignments.
  THink people who found VW software issue.  University researchers.
  But (anecdata) thousands of MOT workers had opportunity and
  knowledge.

- privacy vs secrecy (see Lanister, Data Dignity)

  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29053003

  Secrecy is where they don't know anything about you. (And that is long gone)

  Privacy is where they know everything about you, but are not allowed
  to exploit you. (And that is the fight for the next decade)

  Progess is where they know everything about you, and can assist you
  in your best interests. (that's my conjecture)

  Why it matters - we are entering an age of awful awesome progress.
  We as a society need to find ways to openly discuss, agree on and
  decide the trolley problems of the new century.  Mustering the
  political will to move to non carbon lifestyle is one thing -
  finding ways to decide how to use the dangerous new technologies is
  a different form of political action we have rarely seen before.

  Most likely template is citizen juries and so on 

- Dmeocracy in companies. DOuble down on democracy.


- Programmable Society, Company and Person.

What wont it fix

- politics.  Politics is about deciding resource allocation and what
  should be changed about current system.  Thats exactly the
  pre-software part.  So tech solutions like Arab Spring wont
  help. Arab Spring was human politics.

- biology, climate change and everything else - we have no silver
  bullets for politics.  That is just hard work and economics.

COnjectures and hot takes

* We are all socialists now.

  Social regulatory environment- it's the police and the roads and the
  justice system etc.  It's what makes it possible for companies to
  innovate so they should jot get too bent out of shape when
  regulations prevent monolooes - we are looking for the ideal
  balance. it's not government central planning, it's not monopoly -
  it's jot anarchy.  it's somethingjusing market proce mechanisms -
  and sensible regulation.  What do we mean sensible ... hmm ... let's
  use scientific method?


* Better allocation of credit (Elon etc) (Delegation is crap, just do the job using co-ordinating
protocols (which is 50% of mgmt)

* Death of Project Mgmt
* death of middle mgmt
* mgmt is 50% co-ordination (you are not reporting in way that makes it possible to comapre you)
  and 50% resource allocation (hire, fire, fund, defund) and 50% risk mgmt
  co-ordination is use of common protocols. (DevManual?)
  resource allocation is important, but can be *voted* on
  Risk mgmt - much much better done in open discussion and voting, open reporting.
  Overall, open reporting is a very good idea.
  "In the same way tytping pools were replaced with everyone doing their own typing,
  much of management will be replaced with open discussion and everyne contributing to management"
  "THis will either lead to death by committee, or to protocols that monitor for success and track"
  

* Death of Mgmt (again) If you aren't doing it, don't take credit for it.

  At best you have the architectural plan in mind, unless you build
  with robots, it's still not your creation




  Software literate org: knight capital isn't nor is OPm - because that should be in their bones



We are all living in a socialist utopia 
----------------------------------------
Teach our kids to share
look at index funds - if common ownership is fine then what is socialism
if we include regulation in socialism then everything is regulated for the common good anyway.

Where we fail it's monkey level reactions to the unfairness (see 2008) 


Democracy in companies
- start small.
- why should we assume the current ltd company approach (designed for minimising losses in expeditionary shipping ) is really the right way now?

Software literacy, greater access to information (I mean Inknow more about the meetings of US cabinet than Indonabout the board meetings for my employer)

End of "management" 
------------------
- see end of johnson and hobson  and GE 
- what does mgmt add? 

politics is a change package - people vote for that 

taste is what people ask for - see elon musk 

the problem here is the vision need articulating then people buying into that and having skills for it

problem is then preventing

Conclusion
----------

Yes. But we lack two things to make that paper to digital move convincing

1. A clear unambiguous security framework (HSM, FIDO, on disk
encryption, standard terminology for roles access etc) that is just as
common as HTML. There are so many competing strategies here let alone
implementations that we just really need one winner that everyone can
just drop in to their industry CRM / HR app whatever

2. Legal framework around private data that has social benefits baked
in, but limits the crappy side.

3. Stop thinking we can solve the rest of the worlds problems (with
technology). There is a tendency for say crypto or tor to think it
will create another Arab Spring and whole world will be free. A far
far better bet is to build our democracies better, clean out our
corruption and uneven playing fields, to make a free and fair society
that is just so damn enviable, others have to follow.


Our modern administrative states can do wonderful things – they build
roads and schools, provide healthcare (sometimes), they can care for
the poor and regulate workplaces. But they can also produce
spectacular and horrifying amounts of violence. It is this task – the
violence, not the schools or the roads – for which they were designed
and to which they remain best suited. We forget this (by pretending
such violence belongs only to HBO and the distant past) at our peril.


Also systems thinking vs reductionism - the whole is the interactions
between the parts and is greater than the sun

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28886764

Is that how we should build our orgs:

- decisions are resource allocation decisions.

- decisions are at the systems level (ie programmable companies are unit components) systems are where interactions matter

- 10M isnlower boujd 100m upper

- stop having people decision makers outside those roles - own the lower components to produce a given effect or are building a component t 


Writing is a form of technology - we spend ages learning not alphabet but how to construct words and sentences to express ideas in minds of others 

software is a way to express ideas in executable form - interactive literacy??

Also productivity: it's crap because most organisations have dead weight - either extractive financial situations (private equity) or middle abs top management - smaller leaner companies will be more productive - how we learn to build better organisation s 


It's about preprogrammed responses 
-----------------------
war, the trolley problem and organisational responsiveness


https://warontherocks.com/2020/06/chinese-debates-on-the-military-utility-of-artificial-intelligence/

The next world war will teach us that the winner had already planned their moves and fired them off before the other made a decision

Preprogrammed responses are needed in HFT world - where guessing opponents move is valuable

So prororogmmed moves in business ? contextual as well 


Big Tech is not so big. 
-----------------------
https://twitter.com/realnatashache/status/1451624440022716418?s=21

Tech is 2% employment but 25% S&P - so ... it's not the world.  the world remains uneaten and you cannot compete against Google because a) it cheats (see anti trust stuff on ad server exchange https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28965949) and b) it's way more software literate than you are.  So become software literate as an organisation  


Front Line Only organisation - where there is no chnage management, it just runs.  What about? That's the coding the programming. that changes. And policy is explicit 

see also - code that google ran to cheat on exchanges 


Why democracy
-------------
Because it is only way for employees that will lose all privacy at work to have control over how that is used - will be feedback loop ito society 

No diff between a medicalmorientated dara that has interests of user at heart legally or totalitarian


Book Outline
============

<image of maltese falcon>

.. epigraph::

   I distrust a close-mouthed man. He generally picks the wrong time
   to talk and says the wrong things. Talking's something you can't do
   judiciously unless you keep in practice.

   -- Sydney Greenstreet in The Maltese Falcon

Generally we don't see *talking* as a technology.  Not like Steam
Trains or Rocket Ships.  Often *writing* is not seen as a technology -
what we *write with* might be (a biro, or a laptop) but in general
putting words on paper is ... natural.

Only it isn't.  Humans are the only creature on the planet that writes
its language.  And possibly the only one to have an advanced language.
A language at its simplest uses a gutteral sound as a shared symbol -
this sound *means* "mysterious yellow thing that burns" in my head and
your head.  This "one simple trick" enabled an ape in Kenya to
explode, to teach and understand the world not just from ones own
experience but passed down from others experience.

A few thousand years later, these languages met another technology -
writing. And suddenly you could learn from the stories and expeirence
of people far away or even dead.  It made communication better.

Look i dont need to extoll the virtues of *literacy* to someone
reading a book.

But my conjecture is that there is another form of literacy, another
technology recently invented.  It allows symbolic manipulation in
*both* the heads of other humans and in a new head - a computer CPU.

I think software is a new form of literacy.

This is not an uncommon point of view

We start with the printing press and the Cabinet Office Minister.
When a government minister is esposing your clever viewpoints, its
time to look deeper.

But it is the right thinking

So what did printing press usher in ? A new age of common literacy
(well middle class literacy).  And that ... changed the world.  Within
a hundred years, the centralised power of the Catcholic church had
been replaced by Kings and States that could find enough people
outside the church to *adminsiter* their tax raising efforts, their
complex co-ordinattion needs, and the end of the Middle Ages.  The
church was suck dry of wealth in both catholic and protestant
countries, who found they could do without the amdinsitrative
abilities of the literate record keeping monks.

(expand on the retinue of retinues, centralised states, and into WW2
for unfettered state violence - and democracy and individual rights as
a check on that unfettered control)

(and is software a new means - my argument is yes. directly not by
proxy as in accountancy, and project managers as retinues (ie cannot
centrally know what is going on without asking all the monasteries)



reasons for writing : pg / joel / were social proof that our way of
thinking was valid. it was useful to point others at the
*implications*.  i am hoping similar social proof

Also my brain is feeling full - I want to clear it out a bit and make
room for some new stuff




software literate
writing literate - ability to use this technology to express, communicate and shape ones own thoughts

software - again

if you are writing-illiterate you cannot do this (richard briers - many other factors but all being equal)
and if you are software illiterate you cannot use this technology to ... do things you cannot explain to a illiterate person  




with software literacy we come to the idea of programmable company

What is programming - code and executing code over that data.

Now we have idea of programmable company. But extend that to programmable society and programmable people

immutable corporation 

why try and make it an adaptable organisation ? see war and tehchnilgy 

do one thing. then destroy it - no need for project mamnagers and so on to *chnage* the company.  just design it to do one thing. 

gig economy? what will be our social guide? if not work? 



democratic company
------------------
Management: 
- resource allocation
- strategic cohesion
- monitoring and understanding data 

thats all going to change 
- monitoring is automoc, voting will do resource allocation - rest is politics 

Why do i care so much about society and so on? Apart from my liberal bleeding heart ...

https://acoup.blog/2019/06/12/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-iii/

so look at transition from Roman Europe to Early
middle ages (dark ages) to late middle ages.  The early part is retinue of retinues - unable to know what is going on in any timely
manner there is a only one way to manage.

But accountancy allows one a view (by proxy) into all parts of the kingdom
And a literate bureaucracy can use that 



death of project management is basically the death of retinues of retinues as it becomes possible to administer a company centrally (ie persuade retinues) 

So the immutable ledger (blockchain) is part of a change where top management can see abs drill down into any aspect in near real-time - eliminating the need for retinues and allowing decision between force and power (democracy and non-democracy)

Democracy is harder, often slower, doubtful, but more comprehensive and in my hope more impala able 

most ceos will talk about importance trust and reputation 


Immutable company
-----------------

Why innovate *inside* a company when it is doing the thing we want? At some point a utility is a utility and we want it to stop growing / changing and just provide the damn service already. 

Gas companies laying hydrogen pipes.  Sounds good.  Why not have a hydrogen company? Or solar ? why are we paying for it without the decision ? who voted ? whomallocared? 

Programmable Company
--------------------

The revolution is when the data in a company is arranged in a way it can be iterated over - all of it.  A programmable company - a computable company 

No spreadsheets passed around, just data lakes and rivers and streams and tributaries 

But this means everyone is a coder - it means software literacy
  
We see people today unable to code and so they have detailed subject matter expertise but cannot codify it for use in the programmable company.  It is sometimes easier to teach a coder to be an expert, than the expert to code, but it is better to pair them up (rather than design documents)

How do we get to programmable company
--------------------

The KPI guide to democracy
--------------------------
OK - flying wedges vs marching ranks - it's much easier to guide a flying wedge.

Weak analogy but let's assume a nice big company.  They have a monthly board meeting and at the board meeting there are 20 KPIs - how are they produced - well the COO's deputy emails and gathers and spreadsheets are sent and ... 

One day they decide to improve this - and slowly all the tickets in one place, all the work done recorded, all the databases etc etc. And this is hard honestly - most companies run on "my spreadsheet on my desktop is source of truth for my area and you can prose it from my cold dead hands"

Now the COO presses a button abs great !  But why keep this to the board? What if they publish this button to all the business? What if everyone can read the code and see the databases - suddenly would it be move to make sure that tour area is no longer red? Well let's improve that thing - yes some gaming, some manipulating but then the COO can use a diff measure.  Oh this needs to be announced and beta tested and - it's beginning to sound like economics 

A programmable company also can be a transparent company - which will lead to a democratic company if we trust it.

We can have authoritarian companies if we just demand the reporting goes upwards - but if we accept that those KPIs can be challenged and improved - then we will be bettered off
  
  
Trust 
voting

The lessons and models that we will explore as companies try to handle programmability will be valuable for programmable society


 
Getting to programmable society
------------------------
- Doubling down on democracy
Hypocrisy and "doubling down on democracy"

The pg idea that we should not stop entrepreneurs from building the new land - that this is what makes america vibrant misses a big part of the story

Getting to the top, when using / exploring others is what we complain about in other less democratic societies

It is not about winning at all costs, it is not about winning for my side.  The insidious part of pg argument is that it is not racist or sexist - it is power-ist- it is those who have power deserve to have power irrespective of how they got it.

airbnb cheated. paypal cheated uber cheated.  And won.  they did nit murder or bomb or gas.  It was not that bad.  But it wouldn't it stand up in court

it's hypocrisy 

democracy sits in a spectrum - every dictator in their high castle still must pay attention to the mob

and we are not on the far end of that spectrum 


150 years ago america paid bounties on native american scalps, 75 years ago state sponsored terrorists in white hoods, often employed by police departments, used violence to prevent blacks from voting, today children are ripped from their mothers arms as they cross borders abs thrown into jail

no. Doubling down on democracy is  not just carrying on as we are. it is living up to these ideals.  what is needed is not "we stopped"
but truth and reconciliation.  And yes compensation often says you are truthful in your statements.

and building new companies is not just carrying on cheating as we are, leaning on the systemic injustices to allow some people achieve power more easily.  Sharing power at executive level with employees and stakeholders is costly - just as redistributive compensation is costly.

It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to break the system that made him rich.

building new companies means changing more than the algorithms in the CRM.  New enterprises need to change at a software level - and at a deep organisational level 
  
  
  
People who promote the idea of a sharing economy are not planning on sharing the wealth.  That is not the society that *can* be created nor is it the society that will act as the shining beacon.

I believe in democracy and individual freedom.  I believe it is a gift all sentient beings on the planet should live under.  in order to get there we have found that it's very hard to impose democracy.  We may find using force to prevent great evil a choice but another parallel choice is to make our society a beacon.  double down on democracy- which will mean changing our society as much as our companies.






programmable company - we are moving through tactics to operations and into strategy as what gets automated and controlled centrally (with human oversight not gatekeeping)

Additionally I want to have swardley maps and Communism / capitalism / producers versus owners - need and rise of unions vs gig economy 



Management in a programmable company
--------------------
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28206536

some conjectures

- it's all about the ApIs - see stevey drunken thing

also it's about coding - if co-ordination between parts of company is an important part of the management role then that's a coding issue

if co-ordination is reallymallocation of resources (hey we could do this, we should do this, we are allocating resources to do this) are all different "management" ideas  - so we differentiate between

- model / monitor / mentor
which is day to day stuff that can be automated apart from mentor

we have administration 

and we have actual resource allocation - real budget control

if someone has budget control in excess of 50x their own salary then 

Ultimately we need to automate the "staff work" - the operations part of tactics / operations / strategy

A large company thinks it is like a flying wedge of calamari - really it is a mass of infantry and miles and wagons and siege trains trying to move over difficult terrain 

(war is no longer profitable - https://acoup.blog/2021/08/20/collections-teaching-paradox-victoria-ii-part-ii-the-ruin-of-war/)

So we see companies that live and breathe as organisms but cannot adjust quickly and cannot pass on their knowledge.

A company that can model itself and then plan the action based on inputs has an advantage - 
  
 
* second order
do we ask novelists to estimate their deadlines for delivering each chapter? and expect the chapters in order? And we discuss scope and cost and quality 

Sometimes a business model demands it (charles dickens) - but 
  
- It's all about the data
The old one about the factory that has steam engine spindle and then tries to make same electric engine. not till all distributed around did electrical revolution occur

same for computers - why don't we have a 
 
  
  
- project management 
* happy path, or measuring how many bricks on the happy oath we have walked along
* risk management - identifying and budgeting for likely risks 
Agile is well structure for risk management - continuous delivery of working software (with comprehensive automated testing suite)  all the rest is bullshit

* steering - handling the daily unidentifiable risks and escalating the ones we don't know about 

* heretical view : just don't outsource software development - it's like outsourcing your brain. 
Either buy an existing product (there is almost always an app for that - preferably open source so you can use your brain again) or develop it in house - it's either vital to you, or just buy a new one.

Otherwise you are an investor in a start up - treat accordingly.  don't worry about pldetailed planning - invest in many 

- programmable company
  If everyone is literate what can change about the company? why is it different
  

  
- swardley maps, coase and 
  org design

- model monitor mentor 


- maps and war games - org design and eco systems - coase

- social media - lots to discuss but it's not one thing - mixing publishing and printing and feed selection and discovery - also moderator problem is really not a problem for facebook - it's that we published every conversation in every pub in the world.  This really is an education issue


- moop - how to be better ...

- education - mastery learning as a basis - means learning via computers - but also
implies moop and other areas (ie better financial sense) 






- regulation morality and software - everything requires upfront design including moral decisions - how does democracy handle the trolley problem
see the covid decision process in number 10 - clearly sub optimal - it's that each decision must be made in assumption  it's going to be shown how it was made - so make the org do it that way anyway - the org infrastructure (civil service - model monitor mentor) is there while the policy decisions are human

- is it all in the model? No but we must talk models - software again - good software modelling languages 

- alternate history and modelling - it's about how facts change but the system rolls on

- transparency in decision making (it's really really hard !!!) - is going to be one of democracy finest solutions - but this is about

- evolution of organisations (local maxima is one boss in charge - can see that failing at number 10)

- hardware and software security
https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/57199.html

Impact of breaches 
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27718529



- big changes
start with Yes Prine minister and that nothing changes - see brexit trump wage stagnation
These political big changes are around societal organisations  - and the big change recently has been software and hardware enabled - and all the coming changes will be in software - we all need a software mind 


- different organisation types 

Dr Ola Johannson, Professor of Geography at the University of Pittsburgh explains that Sweden has a culture of collaboration, which plays into its vibrant music scene. “Swedish organisations beyond the music industry are known to have what we call a ‘flat decision-making structure’ where everybody participates equally, whether you are the boss or not. I think for song-writing, that type of social model turned out to be very useful.” Ola suggests that this approach has its roots in the social democratic project of the 20th Century, which spans far wider than the music industry. “It has reshaped Swedish culture in many different ways. For example, it is customary in Sweden to talk to everybody using the first name, there’s no Mr or Sir – beyond maybe the King.”

- death of project management : 
Think 1950s. you had one person gonna collect the state of many activities. they then became obvious point for authority about change from above / redirection of resources

but now that's a automated status reporting - so any resource allocation decisions can be made but who do they affect?  1. you need a model (see apple and their todo list) but two it's a flatter structure

It's not about communication - it's about organising

We see internet as communication medium - it is and we see ends of platforms in mobiles
yes 

but steam engines 

but it's about how we organise work - that makes it more efficient t 
- it's coase
it's ledgers
it's programmable companies 
it's model mentor etc
it's putting the computer back into productivity statistics

Software eats the world

a good description of this issue

Economic rent problem and housing
-----//--
https://youtu.be/niUsivEtAls

not sure why it's software related other than picketty 

Actually it's a history story:  Agricuktural rent - housing rent to robot rent? Where is the wealth stored and where is it generated? 
rent is a problem with distribution of wealth - and UBI and other regulatory solutions do not use the power of decentralised markets and prices (which we like for efficiency)

Housing

Going up because we don't build enough houses - partlty - but mostly due to increase in credit supply chasing houses

problem with modern monetary theory (money supply should equal production levels) is economic rent - extraction of money for no value- which makes hard to measure 


Future of google 
----------------
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26887451

Basically will they reveal their algorithm - are they promoting sites that provide advertising feeds



Why agile is appealing
-----------------------

I don't like management 
it's about squidgy people

but also it's about defining what those peoples roles are abs training them and setting levels and so on - but that's a lot easier with code - so why not replace people 


Price mechanism
and decentralised control 
and maybe diner thing else?
- is internet all humans to humans comma - is it possible that can replace price mechanism? 

Also people I don't like and why their ideas piblically states seem good - farafe and cummings

garage - just what was obvious 30 years ago - walk through UK issues

cummings - what is coming - more concerned - different choices? 


Better Os 
---------
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security
The point here is lacking transferable capability security we ended up with virtualisation solving this problem (plus others like multi tenancy).

plus others like run this exactly 


Democracy 
---------
Double down on democracy
- take detour to discuss Joseph schumpeter - he saw democracy not as a ideal in itself but as a method to discover what the people want - and the current democracy is not ideal
for that - so there can be a lot of experimentation 


One Inwoukd like to see is common now in project mgmt - rank ordering.  It is slowly entering program management - and it is hitting the ceiling of politics - if you rank order by the people, the resource allocation decisions are made by default and as such why have management / executives

But we could see new companies springing up - smaller companies and as such anoento select on their values systems - 

The flaw in the problem of ignorance. We don't need well informed electorates beyond a certain point - we can allow the market to find the efficient means to deliver a desired goal.  We just need to know enough to decide the stack ranking of each market - we need to understand the ramifications of prioritising climate co2 reduction against say the farming industry

See each market as a cell in larger host - and the democracy decision is what (minimal) regulations to use to put the desired relative weights of one against the other 


Schumpeter sees democracy as a completion between different "manifestos" of the political class - the one with the best persuasion wins. He explicitly links it to advertising 

But, looking at the cambridge analytics scandal and the problems - there is a correlation / causation problem.  Simply having slick advertising or 

You can poison the well, ala negative campaigning - but then who drinks from a poisoned well. 

You cannot tell who we are from our likes, and even if youndid get enough data to map us, i doubt you could craft a precise target ad more effective than "save the whales" or just "have some tax rebates".  Much like MKUltra the old standbys of bribery and threats will work just as well. (cf google va duck duck go)


And you cannot be all things to all people as your opponent will delight in pointing out your inconsistencies - we are in a competence market after all 



We are not so easily fooled.  Is the simple answer - human brains grew large it seems to deal with the problems of politics and game theory as tribal sizes grew.


Maps abs war gaming
-------------------
Use war gaming as a means to handle large scale organisational decisions and problems - agree a model (model mentor monitor) and see where we get to 

- organisational planning - model monitor mentor and use swardley maps and war gaming and probabilities to decide best / most likely safe course ? 

Organisational design as a future strength for humanity 


We are not so easily fooled
---------------------------
New forms of democracy
Brexit and trump and five star - all voted for with eyes open by adults.
Might not like it but it's real.

universal morality 
------------------
It's not universal morality 
it's more globalised regulation means we shall have to "align" our laws etc and a lot of that will be aligning our moral stories - this will almost always be a ratchet up effect - we shall choose the best globally 


Political entrepreneurship
--------------------------

Just as we think all the choices have gone, there is a political entrepreneur waiting to sell us more - beach left right ice cream and uk politics - new options, new sales

Is waiting for a manifesto correct? What about voting out / in executives in corporations? 

It's next obvious step.

What about using rank ordered policies ? 

Programmable company still needs men's rea or it will just be an AI seeking goals (paperclip goop)


Programmable company : coherent organisational mind coded in software - can be read and reviewed 
- cf Japanese armed forces in WWII - major reason they lost was massive rivalries in army and navy - only reason pulled together for midway was emprerors life was threatened by doolittle (cf twin towers) 





So we need an ideal, we need vision and political eneprshop - but we also need that to more quickly guide the faster moving programmable more agile company - companies are getting ahead of our morality - that is not a problem with morality - it is a problem of the speed of feedback

Democracy is the right feedback mechanism - and we need to find better faster ways to guide the AI towards its goals - rank ordering, executive replacement etc

Coase tells us we could get down to a one person mega firm, but schumpeter tells us we would just have that guided by nothing - so we need to insert democracy 

(schumpeter democracy is genuine competition between polictakn entrepreneurs offering different packages and asking for power) 


More democracy in companies has three implications

- equitable share of profit 
(vote for me for a pay rise)

- coherent policy (smaller company, break ups etc)
hard to sell a manifesto covering a giant conglomerate - tax issues etc will surface

- political neutrality will divide - but they are not neutral. won't people vote to lobby on some subjects not others? 


Possible future - 
- active shareholders exist - they try to enact a policy 

but what if they present an entirely new executive - CEO etc.

Then that is schumpeter democracy.  and as such it's a competition between political elites

And then what if the major blocks of votes, like black rock and pension funds, what if hey put web site up saying how do you want us to vote your 17 shares? 

Shareholders democracy ... what about employee democracy? Every employee becomes a shareholder? 

Do we do one share one vote or one person one vote? This is landowners vs commenters 
200 years ago it was obvious that landowners should vote for parliament because they owned all the shares (ie land) - but today it's one person one vote 



See the no 18 bus ride / recovery trial as "what you get when ask software mind to design a company"


The software mind is one where you have to hold all pieces in your head and design a way thorough - it is one of transparency and efficiency abs refactoring

- it's basically software needs things to be explicit - the assumptions etc.  And if it's not the software is insanely hard to write

and you cannot easily hide your biases ...

It's transparent abs auditable ....

Drivers co-operatives fighting back in the gig economy 
---------------------

- cuts lyft and uber out of loop.

Bullshit ideas
--------------

Gig Economy : exploring the workers with software

Rental economy : it's only more efficient until demand exceeds supply, then it's prices rocketing up - owning items like snow shovels is a form of price stability hedging


Shape of future society
-----------------------

Firstly we can start with basics - 4biloikn smartphones we are all connected.  how does this shake out?
covid - we are not nations but one biosphere
- so are  atkins a useful idea? Common regulation - uber and amazon 
The EU and the african thing - future hope of society

But let's look at moop- it's where this stuff goes

but look at the obvious one - medicine. what lifestyle is most healthy.  This ooos an easy one - e felt look at Russia - life expectancy of 65 (pension age 66). Will the medical advice from epidemiology be "don't live under a mid-income dictatorship?"

the answer for western democracies - double down on democracy - look at EU look at thaler and libertarian xxx - look at sensible defaults - look at agents that actually work on our behalf 

MOOPs is the collection of data.

Agents acting in the best interests of user is the *advi e* based in the mass collection of data.

The next Larry Hagman in Dallas won't be actor pretending to be happy  - but will be a digital champagne socialist - sharing wealth of a country and not exploited by corporations and others - but aware and trading i off - the end of caveat emptor 

Other implications
- mesh networking will become a NSA funded thing - like TOR designed to undermine dictatorships.  it's probably the one most effective thing - but it will also allow fake news to spread.

so we need to find ways to inoculate society - and that's still a great great challenge - mostly relying on the common sense of most people. 
it's not that bad an idea? children a/ education 
Idea: alternative history gives interesting way to validate my mental models of democracy against yours - if we arrive at same society we have same operating models - and really that's what we care about in a democracy - shared oersting models

and guess what software is good at?

Search is crap now
------------------
https://sparktoro.com/blog/in-2020-two-thirds-of-google-searches-ended-without-a-click/

- It's so easy to spam with words now that it's more or less reached the point where google cannot tell difference between a valuable blog post by an expert and SEO manufactured rubbish


- So they keep you on site (sort of like a vast encyclopaedia)

- or you bounce to high trust curated sites (stack overflow) (NB - all props to Joel but once again labour is not rewarded equal to the value created - those are *unpaid* moderators making the site valuable.

- So there needs to be a cost in production of the content - youtube for example - want to see how to lay laminate floor, well you need to have a camera and a person and he'll a room with laminate flooring needed - that's a big cost. Lowes has made a video, so have dozens of contractors.  It's amazing how tool rental firms have not advertised on there ... actually that is a bit weird

Search quality is crap

The open source quandary
------------------------
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25896351

- essentially OSS circumvents the gatekeeper of purchase orders - so we end up using code with odd licenses and no one knows when where (ie npm)

- redhat has the right approach and I expect this to expand - there will be curated open source companies supplying not just licensed code with verified supply chains but also expertise

also internal politics of a company are almost entirely non-market (patronage society)
patronage bad way to run society - see "get colonised by the british"

Most companies internally are still in 1980s digital - and looking to advance - imagine a world where we say "look at that market opportunity - i should take over the invoicing dept by being more efficient han them"


Big Future changes

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27738312


Warfare and software
--------------------

Technological changes have driven warfare throughout past 150 years and it is likely software will be no different 

The most obvious area is drones or Unmanned Combat Aircraft Vehicles - The communication between operator and vehicle, or the autonomous operations software will be the largest attack surface - with every chip made there is a possibility of a back door.


Should governments have a monopoly on information ?


Programmable company
---------------------

> To understand a program you must become both the machine and the program.
- Epigrams in Programming, Alan Perlis

One of the major reasons why large companies become so hard to manage (imo) is they are hard / impossible to reason about.  Accountancy gave a way to reason about a company but money is just a proxy for real work

Maybe Apple is a effective company because Apple is built around the operating rules - making it easier to reason - it is first of programmable companies

Programmable company same as Robot Operating system - event driven architecture 

Limits to future growth
-----------------------
https://www.cold-takes.com/this-cant-go-on/

of course there are

medicine, public health, mechanisation, electrification and digitisation all in same century !

As we slow we want better ways to decide how to arrange the resources

- my politics - monkeys and veil of ignorance

- double down on democracy - use companies as breeding ground for new workable democracy 


How is software relevant to this? Because software represents a low margin cost to change. It is lowest capital cost

And if we want to have a growing economy with reduced externalities (ie climate change) we need to find a way to each year reduce our emissions by say 1% whilst maintaining production.  That's across the whole globe.

It is unlikely we can do this by investing in new capital plant continuously - a coal fired power station is a big investment.  we cannot keep re-investing in capital

so we need to improve organisationally - having less, doing with less. This will involve better supply chain insights, probably some form of advertising is bad because it works against the "best interests"
of the citizen

There is a lot to change - urbanisation leads to dramatically different behaviours in monkey brain (stressful) so we will see some pasturel breakouts - urban environments tuned to reflect pasturoal and positive effects (see barcelona / strong towns / etc)

But most of all software allows people to monitor and nudge themselves along better routes.

We need a public interest guidance software (MOOP) - we won't get outbid this unless we become better people.  Software might help us do that.  We might then trust the software - but it's recommendations need to come from double blind tests - unethical - or massive epidemiology (now feasible as we measure our lives in our software)

We already live in a socialisat paradise - it's going to get full on Star Trek (without the space battles and sex with aliens) - the whole "communising in space thing"

I don't see a way monkeys will manage to do it otherwise.  It might be why we have not been visited.  Getting past this state might be challenging.  


Open and political companies
------------------

Science is going open source
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28105966

But look at major political campaigns - constantly taking the temperature of electorate using polling data.  It is really the only way - but why aren't companies internally (look at how badly google handled many internal political issues)

Polling employees will lead to more political work yes - but that happens anyway, just amount the "elite".  Just make it more democratic 

Why most bug internet companies are just regulatory avoidance
--------------------
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28131737

Barter does not scale - and the "free market" thing only looks good at barter level.  Counchnsurfing - cool, free market interactions with individuals - airbnb - less cool 

Crypto currency

Digital Natives
---------------
Not so much

https://www.geeklawblog.com/2015/10/the-myths-of-digital-native-part-1.html

Market scale
------------
I used to do business analysis - see notes on columbus 
But facebook abs amazon abs apple have broken into a new global market (well bipolar market).  This is a market of 8 billion people.  To have an addressable market of a million people now requires something of interest to 1 in 8000! The amount of fractal
splitting to come isnimmemsnse 

Who need a minimum scale of market (Adam smith) to build enough wealth - and so a global market with a globally addressable market is going to allow greater specialisation 

markets: three dimensions wealth, standard of living, flourishing of potential (essentially how do we serve maslows triangle)





Political ideology
------------------

Anti-fascism / extremism

https://acoup.blog/2021/02/19/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iii-the-cult-of-the-badass/

left right is a circle not line

Fascism essence: 
If only some people are ‘warriors’ and developing that warrior capacity towards violence it the primary or principle virtue, it follows – and literally any Spartan could have and would have told Pressfield this – that everyone else is merely fit to be ruled.

This is the true "elite" problem.


fairness/ equality
- monkey lab and veil of ignorance

- free markets 
https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/econtalk/id135066958?i=1000531460313

warning:
Instead, it merely repackages that siren song that tells disaffected young people (mostly men) that they can be special and heroic through violence. No need to do the hard work of moral improvement, of difficult questioning, of – to quote Tolkien, “valour without renown.” Instead, it tells such men that they are already special, an elect within society, the ‘sheepdogs’ among sheep and encourages them to hold the sheep in contempt. It tells them that the things they already believe are not merely true, but the truest things.

The calculus of fascism / slavery / military elites in pre-industrial society - it's possible for everyone to be nice and subsistence farmers in equal society (barring weather disease etc etc)

but once one person takes control of a society and uses violence to make slaves of others, and then uses their surplus to create superior weapons (hang on how did get build the skills base? by having slaves anyway and using surplus to research).  Once one society does that all others need to similar else be defeated.  Wars are won with surpoerior weaponry and doctrine and training.  Things only surplus and then leadership can supply 

utilities:

google will become utility - boring - but necessary

utilities: 
not neomliberalism - look at tap water - free, 
really you think the market will provide? and taking existing vast investment and then privatising it ... yeah where's my return on tax investment ? 


Riots and fairness
------------------

People kind of are rioting, though. The election of Donald Trump (and the rise of populist parties across Europe); the January 6th capitol riot; the Black Lives Matter movement - whatever you think of these things, they're all connected at some level to a deep-seated feeling of social injustice. Perhaps we're only at the start.

https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=28740183&goto=item%3Fid%3D28738407%2328740183

Riots are usually ineffectual at expressing real change - change is supported when someone or something expresses a solution to the underlying feeling - we are searching for it.  I think the search continues 

we are seeing a legitimacy crisis of major ivatituitojns that support status quo - parliaments, police, finance etc 
 
 
 Regulation
 ----------
 the great facebook fail (dns down 4 oct) - the impact on communities using whatsapp as a utility is enormous - the right answer - to force it onto open protocols, to ensure countries and companies can renamed mesages much like email.  can this be done? 
 
 Facebooks algorithm problem - that the newsfeed is too big for a chronological approach, no one wants to write their own filters, so ... they need to invent something that guesses what you want (or should want, or want to want) - and that is somehow restricting other peoples free speech or something - but ultimately it is impossible - and so facebook essentially is asking for suitable regulation - and this is another trolley problem - define upfront what kind of society we think we are / want to be.
 
 
 we do it when we define the syllabus for our kids education, we just need to do it more often and in other areas
 
 upfront decisions are now an important issue - we probably want to have commissions on these things - 100 or so people coming out and making a recommendation (after informed expert opinion)
 
It seems a sensible approach
