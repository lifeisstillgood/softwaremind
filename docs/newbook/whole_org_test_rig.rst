not until extra load added and twosted
point is nowadays we have mich more modelling of behaviour
but we dont model the software emgeering - thisnis something we shoukd od and will have to do - tomincreas reliability as well as improve reactions 
esp if we get to poijt where others can does that change kiability issues 




#### expand below
A better test rig is orders magnitude more effective than “better communication”
Once a complete prod-parallel environment exists, any management question is answerable directly through exploratory code chnage.

Major chnages (1.x 2.x) can presumably use the same real life feed, see Tesla data advantage.

see Brooks law.

that management is disaggregated and the communication 
value is much much lower 


also primary skill set is learning 
that is the provle we have is one we have never seen before
in this configuretion
so gonaway learn prqxtise and then come back and fix
its not a 9-5 job - its a consuktancy 
so the idea of agile or management or bums on seats is ... off - end of industrialisation (see my favourite door in London, and the need for knowledge workers, like lawyers)


Other management issues
model monitor mentor, internal homestasis of org, whilst meeting external 
needs - politics of status quo and guesstimate changes.

If the communication is gone, if model monitor are better done by software, of process is better done by software, then what we have left is internal homeostasis
Or politics (which will be disrupted by democracy as feudal politics was disrupted - and its the middle class that rebel always)

Mentoring becomes a profession - a profession that is impossible to hold back to a few
It’s a fiat chance that we will find lawyer like prosfessions where they will have a commit bit for the big software - laws, the software for gov depts

What will it look like?
Newsroom of WaPo- managers become editors as it becomes possible to manage a company through code 

Chapter: 21C knowledge workers, 19C practises
=============================================
Chapter: new work organisation - not your 9-5, digital footprints, not planning
forward but auditing backwards, test not trust (ie automated testing not "trust
delegated people will fit it in somehow"


Chapter: policy, process, control
==================================
 
  Software can / does make policy explicit.
  4 quadrant area about DODGY / COMPLEX - INTEGRITY / SIMPLICITY
  SIMPLE / DODGY = Crime (ie LIBOR)
  SIMPLE / INTEGRITY = high performance, high profit, 
  COMPLEX / INTEGRITY = healthcare, space travel,military weapons
  COMPLEX / DODGY = FInancial engineering, 

  implements process
  enforces policy
  Is instantly introspectable
  Careful issues around deep state
  THe quadrant shows the reluctance toallow software and regulation in
  Introspection allows people to ask questions, which in DODGY areas is 
  a problem.  And it allows outsiders to see how sausage is made.

A fantastic idea, and also the philosophy behind Oberon is something I think we shall need more of - as the operating system for a computer is now conceptually the operating system for a network, a cluster of computers, for an organisation, a government, having one company’s “operating system” not only be defined in software, but enable that software to fit in one head, that seems important in ways that otherwise make us throw up our hands and say “it’s all rigged” or “they are all the same” or “who knows, let’s just keep going”


Whole Org Test Rig
------------------

The other important part of the Programmable company - how to find out what changes could have improved your performance over past year.  Replay all the activity against a differetn set of policies / infrastrucutre.  Dont just test will the app survive, test will the org. And will this work best or otehr configurations more effective?
