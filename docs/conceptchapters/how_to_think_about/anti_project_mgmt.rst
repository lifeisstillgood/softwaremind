Everything about Project Management is wrong 
------------------------

Agile has been trying to work its way towards this for years - but "coaches" became managers, "scrum masters" became project managers and now estimates are written in blood

This is wrong.  And is based on a flawed understanding of planning 


the dag points backwards in time !!! 

if a bug is found you simply cannot plan forwards. You cannot predict when you will find the bug, which code it is in, how long it will take to deploy or approve it.

But you can do that chain of causality backwards

project management thinks causality can be predicted - but we know chaos gets in the way

we can only have priority and intent 

and learn from our environment about the difficulty of actin fin 




Let's plan a drive.

I am going to drive from work, to home, picking up a takeaway along the way.  But there has been, as ever, roadworks, abs it's my first time driving back this particular route. 

I have to do some planning.  Check the route on google maps perhaps.  I can plug in a few way points, and off we go.

I want to keep my wife informed, which is good. she does not need the plan beyond some major milestones (leaving, stopping at takeaway, arriving home).  I estimate those times abs off we go.

A detailed view of progress so far is possible. my phone just reports my position (ie progress) so far. 

suddenly the road starts to expand A things take longer 

Is this really a path finding problem in project mgmt ?
