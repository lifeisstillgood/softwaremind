Each iteration neeed some set of technology plus platform to be ready 

web 1 - sufficient PCs plus HTTP plus legal framework

web 2 - I don't think this was (social was just another application - it was the mobile
platform that supercharged it even though it was named early

web 2.5 - mobile platform

web 3 

technologies are obvious
platform is? what?
we are missing something - it might be ubiquitous micro payments (bank of england) 

is the platform server less code? run anywhere (aka bob)

IPFS - allows a content addressed data to decide where to run my code - you choose which data you want to run against and the server less finds where it is closest and runs it (charging you?)

reverse: run code, code looks for data, now it's find data, now look for the code - code is smaller so faster to bring code to mountain than other way round. 

a distributed database that knows where all content is stored, and can be updated privately, and has ability to decide where to run, and get estimates queue times and costs - literally how much is this going to be? 


code lawyers
------------
conjecture of OSS running government - making specialising in that code a legal like profession (possibly being a lawyer and a coder) - and making all sorts of strange outcomes - the most interesting of which is one code base across huge swathes of territory - the dream of the internet may still
come true 

Web 3.0 fanboys
---------------

I have (amazingly) been in industry through both web 1 and 2.  And failed to make billions which I am fairly sore about.  But now I can make my billions - in web 3.0

Let's unpick some of the (over)hype and see what we think is coming down the line and might for the basis of the meta verse / web 3 / whatever 



Good coverage: https://permission.io/blog/web-3-0/

Basics

- content addressable file system (ie IPFS).
- blockchain ledger for supply chain mgmt
- semantic data (see w3c / TBL)
- strong digital identities
- bots and 

maybes 

- micropayments and currency (but i bet in fiat cryptocurrency - so BoE runs the UKP blockchain, at millions of blocks a day)

- smart contracts 
I am negative on this. Just like reversing transactions is a feature not a bug, law courts are a feature of contracts not a bug.

I completely agree that a piece of software that is *part* of a legal contract - modelling it for example - can vastly improve understanding and analysis. Completely replacing hundreds of years of legal development seems like overkill.

- server less computing - code can be picked up and run where abs when ever - and with IPFS data *might* be close.  There is a hell of a lot sub-optimised with this idea - but it is attractive for most things most businesses want most of the time.  My guess is that the ratio is about as often as you need to drop to C for python work.  it has that "feel".  And often most people don't notice they are dropping to C (pandas) - so likely that for some things (touching a data pool) gets queued in servers in a given data centre. 

- bots
Hell yes.

- AI 
like SQL

- ubiquitous connectivity

- 3D immersion
It seems an add on, not a necessity.  But damn it's cool.
