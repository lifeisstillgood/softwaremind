What's wrong g with bitcoin

Permissioned and permsiionleas crypto-coins 

look at the Modern Monetary theory - money supply equals productive capacity 

impact of permissioned is going to be great - because fiat coins are ... representative of the productive capacity of the jurisdictions they represent

and so ...

What are the implications of permissioned fiat currency (the one we are likely to get)?

well firstly collapse of bitcoin.  that will have negative impacts, also there is a huge trail of poor opsec to be followed (assume it's mostly speculation, currency control avoidance and arbitrage and straightforward money laundering)

Implications: 
- no need for deposits (so what do banks do for deposits?) end of fractional reserve banking?

- speed up of trade
- immutable transactions ? but recoverable - but only though the courts.  how do you force a trans action when one party reduces? some form of replacing the coin - coin is marked as ended and cannot be reused and new coin granted.

this demands a PKI - a realmPKI which we have not built yet 

Hardware security modules are everywhere 


good implications - the next round of QE would just be straight into peoples wallets? maybe that's a partly political decision - but yeah they could have done that in 2008.  so not likely really.




Alos:

Nakatomo consensus algorithm: it's not the same as *truth*... space work time - these just are truth of most people most work - truth is not a question

Working out where all the gold is is a physics question - so is working out where productive capacity is.

finance is just an information model around real world economy - don't forget that.

"""I think it's time for us in the tech world to speak out and make it clear the emperor has no clothes here. Cryptocurrency is sustained by a mix of money laundering, vaporware, fraud, ransomware, gambling, and delusion. It has no social benefit except helping end first dates fast"""

The anti gov part is not i  orignal paper and is tacked on by the jeremy  parison / fox news  wing - it's silly "don't trust go ernment - apart from water an roads and ...


First what's right :  crypto ledger
second - open protocol


0. It has no underlying cash flow - 
0. it's not a currency

0. The idea was for every computer to run a few extra cycles for the mining - decentralised mining.  What we have are vast (Chinese) farms

0. As a currency it's run by china (strategic issue)

0. Mostly it's about evading chinese currency controls

0. What's wrong with efficiency - transaction proof 

0. what's wrong with trust? We like analogue trust - it works and we know how to manage it.  Yes con artists get around it, yes we trust wrong people - but competition and openness do fix most of those issues.  We are looking to technology to fix a human scale problem of politics - be open, be equal, ensure competence and accountability  - this is hard we all want unfairness 

abut what's wrong

The people who buy it - basically richer trump
voters - people in the golf bar who believe some consurpiacy theories - also don't trust the government - it's just ... icky 



1. Skewed distribution 
idea is 21 million coins represents all the economy - world economy if something like 100 Trillion - 13 Tn trade and rest infra country, real estate etc

So if satori owns first million coins - he has roughly 20 trillion -  among him the worlds second largest country by GDP - which is fairly fucking stupid.  Imagine the G20 meeting where he announces his plans to buy an aircraft  carrier and - oh fuck it that's never going to happen - it's not a curren y 

Look it started as a cool hack and became a darling of a certain kind of anti government idea, and the idea of crypto currency is a good one -  it right now it's a means of avoiding currency controls in china.  

(imagine a single economy with one car toy making one product - all the output of the factory would need to be purchased so there would need to be enough currency to equally the economic output) 

Electricity usage

anonymous - tracking drug deals, tracking meta data at all

price is too high - and electrical use per transaction per block is too high 

So it's a replacement for swift? Every disruptive use just hits a "why bother with prooof of work" question.

Also debt needs to be registered at a social level - at a level of a trusted third party

imagine I want to borrow a million dollars - you could trnafaer me those bitcoin. is that a debt? if so bitcoin is bot outside the law / third party trust issues.  And look at everyone from sulla to modern day - accusing someone of crimes against the state when you owe them moment is a good way of cleaning the slate.


Bitcoin, any currency, cannot exist in a legal vacuum and the ideological no government attitude just strikes me as odd - money lending become impossible without government (which is why a mafia is usually a government for a people who have no government - either because they are an underclass (Catholic Italians in New York) or geographically separate

Problem of ownership and trust less ownership

- ownership is a legal umbrella
- everyone needs to be under the umbrella
- no one is going to agree because satoshi owns 1 million 
- and so it's just dead 

but the concepts are fine 

fungibility
-----------
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30224637

because traceable then certain addresses and history can be blacklisted - possible to do with people we don't like too 


But also
---------
China rolling out own currency
we could do same - discuss tokens etc

but the problem is fractional reserve banking 

and unless we have a path to get there that is controlled

but essentiallly the big win for regulators is to avoid retail banks - no deposits means no free loan money

which means there is literally no bank too big to fail

which means ... if bank wants to take loan out to meet payroll - it should be better run 

This is "the end of banking as we know it"

Honeytraps
----------

No one knows who (or whoms) satoshi was. But the most impressive conspiracy theory is that this is a long game from the US law enforcement who built this to honeytrapnevery money launderer on the planet into using publically traceable methods to launder their money.

There is a version of the blockchain that has poor opsec and so every single dirty transaction is tracked back to the money launderers - and every single enabler and co-conspirator is laid bare in a sting operation that makes panama papers look like a till receipt

Yeah.  i like it.  And somewhere it is close to the truth 


What if it is all money laundering
----------------------
if it is, money is taken out - but the amount taken out is (including just held) cannot be more than the fee for laundering 

so at some point bitcoin will become too expensive as a form of money laundering - and this kind of means mexican drug lords will have the trigger to cause middle class wealth loss on vast scale  

it's all a bit ... unknown
