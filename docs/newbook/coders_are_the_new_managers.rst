Coders are the New Managers

The Evolving Understanding of Management and organistions
===========================================================

"Management" as a term is fairly modern - probably Peter Drucker is most
responsible for popularising it in the 50s and 60s.  His work laid a path that most
academic work has followed. In his work, Mgmt should be an elite, trained for
highest performance, to innovate, to analyse, to *decide* and *change*.  These
are supermen, bestriding the world.

However things changed.  Management in 1960s were still thougth of as employees,
working for a shareholder class.  And while they got *perks*, they rarely got
*capital*.  And slowly that changed until the 1980s exploded and the majority of
management income came not from salaries but from equity (options).  And slowly
they stopped being "management".

2010s Google - "Eight rules for google management".
HEre the supermen learnt - they studied google and found the best
performing managers. And they ... were sports coaches. "Support your people".
etc

    Be a good coach.
    Empower your team and do not micromanage.
    Express interest in team members’ success and personal well-being.
    Be productive and results-orientated.
    Be a good communicator and listed to your team.
    Help your employees with career development.
    Have a clear vision and a strategy for the team.
    Have key technical skills so that you can help advise the team.


Wait what happened? Where is all the "bend the organisation to your will" stuff.
Where is the "corporate strategy". What happened?

In my uneducated opinion, two things happened. Firstly the management split -
middle management stayed employees, and upper management became capitalists,
financiers.  Companies grew in size, complexity. Globalisation became not just
how things were traded but how companies operated.

(link: accountancy - the non softwaremethods of control, superseeded by direct measurement)

Adn Software happened. The actual work in Google is done by CPUs and GPUs. The
people who marshall and supoervise and direct and organise the workers are the
people committing the code.

The hierachy is broken. The people doing the actual design are not in the hierarchy
so how is the strategy conducted / directed? This is about *mission*, and about
the *whole org test rig* and eventually democracy - the middle class will demand a seat at the table.


The code is the design

The Architects paradox
=======================

If you cannot control the work to each level, you need to leave thigns to chancve
/ others - and then

But with software and robots you can control it all, preplan it all.

Coders are the new managers, CPUs are the new workers
================================================================



  - THoery of firm / how organisations will change


  "When Adam Delved and Eve span, who then was a Gentleman?"

    -- John Ball, (Peasants' Revolt) 1381

Tranisation from managers to coders reduces ability for non technical management
to know what is possible and how to implement next step on phase soace
management is becoming less abke to *dirext* and more able to *prevent* - old
saw of government having engine of lawnmower and brakes of rolls royce
leadership - saying its ok (sniper and injured enemy) impact of remote workinng

with rmeote working either everyone is told about everything

or there is total loss of cohesion - either write it all down and lose political
power or

coders are the new managers
---------------------------

THe new workers are the CPUs. The supervisors and instructions come from the coders - and code is the design.  Look at difference between maangers in Drucker - bestriding the world making decisions, and managers in Googles eight rules - coaches helping keep the employees happy.  And what if employees are not happy - look at OpenAI where an emploee revolt removed the board.  We shall come back to employee ower later. WHy did rome collapse? Collapse of trust and trade.
management is dead -
coders are new managers
management is simple (peter principle)
management can be automated - to raise floor level
modelling
mentoring
monitoring
politicking  (financier and project choosing)
project / activity choice - resource allocation is mostly what *change* to apply - which is mostly a datwining process of project survival - so financing is process of finding successful projects not initiating successful projects
or finding obvious failings and initiating blessed solutions
management training matters but
is that training in coaching (google 8 rules) or training in project initiation and selection or training in political alignment
i hvave sympathy woth the control freaks because there is no standrdisatikn - no process (military word??)
there is need for soijg things this way my
way - commot formats and so on
management is basically xonsrant on job training of others
- linting humans
we live lives of imperfection and pretend every is fine and the dodson are between the two is our stress level - but admitting the truth is a way to find calm and time to fix the imperfections
the great innovations of 1776 enlightenment
democracy
openness / search for truth / scientific method
industrial revolution - automation finance and more
double down on what works
politician - consensus forming / finding

What do we mean by management?
------------------------------

This one we can bang on about for ages.  Everyone from Drucker to the latest
paperback in the airport lounge has some definition.  But I am going to stick to
my Sun-Tzu.  There are 5 "components" of warfare -Landscape, Weather, Mission,
Doctrine and Leadership.  Leadership is the "management" part we are discussing
here, and Leadership can influence the Mission, and change the Doctrine.  But it
cannot change the landscape or the weather.

So I am conjecturing that management of an organisation is the group of people
responsible for, no, *able to change or influence* the culture, incentives, rules
and policies of an organisaitoon.

This usually means people high up in a organisation hierachy, but we all too
often know of upper managemetn unable to change anything.  But *someone* in that
company can.

In the UK we have what is sometimes termed "The British Disease" - where some defitnin of poor managemnt
causes the low productivity seen in UK companies compared to their peers.

Disaggreation of management

So what does management do?

Model
Monitor
Mentor
Politic


Drucker
Shared understanding of the groups common goals (mission)
(also shows where conglomerates exists as shared common goals are too vague)

Use Sun Tzu - 5 areas to master

- Landscape
- Weather
- Doctrine
- Mission
- Leadership



Politics of the Organisation
----------------------------

THe most important part - politics of the organisation

Talk about Paula Vennels, Post Office.
That elites control ing a fiefdom is not usually the best way of getting performance
Can we expect Elon Musk like performance from every manager? Of course we f*****g cannot.
He is a once in a generation outlier for a f****g reason. And I dont know the names of the 100 people
what have worked directly for him over 20 years and shaped the success as much.

But we have found a new means of dealing with politics - we call it democracy.
It comes in funny shapes and sizes, and its very new but we have great hoppes for it.

But self organising sucks (structureless stuff like chiat day)
How to reward people? 
but anyway ... software 
Why need good managers ? to shield younfrom the politics and in foghting?
then the missing part is
democracy. you cannot get rid of politics - but you can 
remove the buts where individiulas are toompowerful 
Reward systems 
Video games teach us that regular frequent rewards are waay better than 
on off rewards. so why have annual appraisals - because having a manager there daily enabked daily approasals and reqard ( at least bu the good managers) 
So remotw work not somgood
having demos very good

The Architect's Paradox
=======================

An architect today can <design> a building, but leave many of the detaisl to be
worked out at construction time (they of course need to ensure load bearing
floors etc etc. But often this not work out - see NEw York famous.) But imagine
we create a robot that injects concrete exactly where its told. At this point te
architect can churn out hundreds of buildings at a time, but they need to
specify *everytrhing*.  This is the problem, opportunity and promise of software
as it eats the world - vast savings, vast control, but now everything must be
much more explicit.

The code is the design
=========================
Articles and discussion - when build is deterministic, the code is the design.
SO from now
on we see a world of programmable companies which are franchises, with a franchise of one.
 Real working policy documents. The goal of SOPpy is to partly allow one to write code
that runs a company, but also to write policy documents that read as policy but execute as
code. Cucumber

There are many silly things in the film Gettysburg (1993), but one moment I just
love is Chamberlain’s exasperation on realizing on top of an already difficult
morning that his regiment has been assigned to the front of the front brigade in
the corps and so has to assign flankers; that rotation would have been regular
in most armies. And what would have happened to create this scene, is that the
commander of the V Corps (Major General George Sykes) opted to march with his
first division in the front, which then its commander (Brigadier General James
Barnes) opted to put the 3rd Brigade in front and its commander (Col. Strong
Vincent) opted to put the 20th Maine in front and of course its commander (our
Professor of Rhetoric, Joshua L. Chamberlain) would in turn have to pick where
each of his companies would go. The main concerns for smaller units is that the
front part of the unit regulates pace and the rear part of the unit will need to
deal with stragglers (including heat and fatigue casualties) as well as keep up
pace to avoid the unit ‘tailing out’ too badly as it marches.

that is real management / leadership - making cog level decisions
that can if got wrong badly adfect everything but if right just keep going

humming along is what (well designed) software can do
when it goes wrong we need to tke action (preplanned automatic action??)
runbooks etc

the less manual the more speed etc etc

yes there is a risk (see automatic driving - hi this is an issue software cannot
handle you have 2 seconds to avoid a crash)



  - how do companies decide?
    robotics useful 
    simple terms - OODA loop 
    observe is perception - collection of data
    orient is collating data into a model that 
    is an effective representation of reality 
    decide is choices based on model, model predictions plus politics
    Act is chnage the code and release 
    how does this help us - it goves model for how
    programmable company can work - we are seeing software eat
    the world at the observe stage - but rarely do we see a whole org
    model that is ontegrated into thise 
    AI is sorta hoped / worried it will do this second stage (and DAnd A)
    but explicitly calling itnout its clear one can easily domit
    but it challenges the existence of feudal
mgmt elite that "understands" the company
    cf VAR - "get me one single number to judge company bu"
    ok but once we do, anyone can judge it - that model is built
    it is available
    counterpojt - there are too mmay variables we have to do this by feel
    yeah bollocks
  - THoery of firm / how organisations will change
  - Coders are the new managers, CPUs are the new workers (as almost every job has co-pilot or enabled by software / robot / machine)

Non Jobs
=========







Non Jobs 80% of 80% -> 96% from 36%. How project manaement will be removed from companies
as
      co-ordination is driven through test rigs and APIs and 'measure of progress is
workig software' A screed against project maangement-ism.  Also why are companies not
using metrics and data to drive outcomes - AB testing your way  to success? Or to be out
of a job?

Chapter: Literary Best practise
===============================
Software demands different best practises
We are finding them - and what it will look like makes WaPo different to a
medieval scriptoreum.
Prod-Parallel and back testing,
Tool use
COmmon solutions (octavio, editing)
THis is The DevManual
To "manage" you need to have an OODA loop.
To "release with confidence" you need to have a prod-parallel env / test rig.
To "plan" you need to have failing tests in the prod-parallel env, that are like
bug bounties for employees.  DO not fall for capitalism here, use socialism
inside the org.

Chapter OODA loop and production ready, tech debt.
==================================================
Observe, Orientate, Decide, Act.
This is operating *on* an existing system. We are managing the system.
If we cannot get metrics from the system, we cannot observe
If we do not have a (software) model of the system we cannot orientate,
(use of Statitical process control)
Deciding is politics - persuasion, allocation of resources, collection of
resources.
Act is development
The main issue is we have *assumed* the model is in the managers head, or
in their holy spreadsheet.  Possibly because the numbers in the sheet are
'dangerous' to pass around.
But with software metrics, thats a choice not a requirement. A model can be
"soft real time" updated, and the VAR number calculated each day.
Deciding is affected to, as differnet costly options can be appplied to model
and prod-parallel for analysis.
And Act is the art of filling in the red failing tests in the prod-parallel.

“It was a bad call ripley a bad call”
The thing is there are skeletons everywhere
Director hazing is also there not just to weed out the bad ones but find the ones who fit, who won’t make waves who won’t “overturn the boat” - even if some boats need overturning

It’s always a balancing act but at some point the skeletons just become self reinforcing - and you either never make any compromising mistakes (see why lawyers have professional ethics) or you find ways to air the dirty laundry often
