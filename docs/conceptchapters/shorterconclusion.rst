Shorter conclusion
==================

Even shorter conclusion
-----------------------

COmputers are missing from the productivity statistics - because
missing proper usage.  (electrification of factories)



A progrmmale company is what you get when you ask a developer to
design a company


And what do you get when you design a society with (software) literacy at its core? 

Two visions: Dystopia and Utopia visions - police state and free state.
Alwatys a good idea to choose utopia.

Software is eating the world - its not done yet.
But it is now "systemically important" and so will be regulated.
Software governance will play a part as the 13th Factor

From a western perspective, double down on what works - what has
driven the past two hundred years.  Transparency, democracy (have
another go in 4 years), - more democractic companies - less
exploitation (ie credit card rates as exloitation) - trust built in -
the greatest trust is in Science, and medicine.  how to replicate
medicoen trust is to replicate "first do no harm" - the wwelfare of
individual patient is paramount at all times.  This is freaking hard.
Discuss smelleiss and the scottish surgeon.


- project management is dead. Programmable companies are
  programmable. They dont need project management they need software
  developemnet life cycles. THis is the real success of Agile.

- fractal management - reporting on your own perfoemance - digital
  foot print analysis

- this will lead to early MOOPS - how to improve maangerial ineter
- personal comms FInally the capabiliteis good enough to lead to
- consumer use and psychologucal agents

- governance and simple and transaprent laws and code
  
- how we run companies will start to leak into how we run socieity
  - Wardley maps
  - models of economy and "our own facts"
  - fake news is just the shake out of "own facts"
  - 

- software and politics again is governace and shared osmosis

- coaseian dieal firm size - and regulations needed to change it (ie
  anti-trust laws allowing co-ordination)


- Trying to judge the essential and the incidental (prblems with pagerank, renting out your domain juice)

- software socualism and open source
  Open source seems most obvious
  Open hardware nash equlibrium
  Open source scandal like UK post office


- where have we moved the complexity - it is rare that we
remove complexity - we have it in people process or technology - and
where we choose to put it and manage it matters


- culture wars and Ok Boomer.
Brexit: trade agreements ante becoming more aligning regulations,
aligning culture.  Iphone is basically starting it from the other
side.


so the more our lives are represented in virtual the more we can
measure it and so harmonise it - so it's about being aware of the
importance and details of these dates - this is thus a good thing of
brexit

moop, life coach and life agency 
if beat intersts of patient is used as the goal then if we stop selling you to advertisers we then start selecting products based on best interests of the patient - in other words legal requirements to agent says only do what's in best interests of patient - so it becomes really hard to offer products that are exploitative - we build a "name of that podcast paternalistic something"


One culture to rule the world
credit suisse issue - yes racism but more importantly it's aristocracy not wanting to have problems on their doorstep - and that's about differences in culture being impossible to resolve without dealing with 

for example today's multi national companies have to internally deal with the problems - american bribery foreign act is impossible to use in UsA
we do business with saudi arabia in saudi normal practise -  but that's not acceptable in USA 

so they deal with it by .... and then the differences come up in a garden fight 

but we cannot keep hiding it in large internal
company culture - it becomes coasian - smaller companies more explicit- 

it's like cities - eventually they find a way to set what is normal - it tends to be unfriendly and formalised - but also accessible??? 
 
software enables  hoice of cultural differences - like regulation you need to have software compatible- like you have an option for "bribery"
