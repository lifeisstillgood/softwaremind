* The Warfare of Genghis Khan, and literacy in society.


The warfare of Genghis Khan
===========================

From the turn of the first millenium AD, Eurasia had a generation or two of
warmer weather across the continent [#01]_.  In Western Europe we saw Crusades
and religious turmoil,
but thousandas of miles to the east, the nomadic Mongolian people had grown in
population and wealth, and were bumping up against the settled peoples of China
and the Silk
Road.  Temushin, later known as Gengis Khan, underwent an epic-biopic-worthy
lifetime, from priviledged chieftans son, to outcast, to tribal leader and
finally founder of a nation. Oh, and brutal mass killer, lets not forget that
bit.

Tribal internecine warfare had always bedevilled Mongolian unity, and Gengis
Khan solved this by absorbing defeated tribes into a new model of army.
the smallest unit of the army was a mounted cavalry unit of ten men, 
an `aravt` with layers of `aravt` strung together in a military hierarchy reaching up to something like a modern day "division" of 10,000 horse borne warriors. 
Important to maintaining *Mongolian* loyalty as oppsed to *tribal* loyalty,  each aravt was always made up of men from many different tribes, so that the army cohesion was based around loyalty
to the Great Khan, not to family.  He turned the tribal loyalty to a loyalty to
the `aravt`, and hence the Khan.

But for us the most important lesson is they were all mounted on horses. Not
"just" the cavalry, but the whole army, and its tail of civilians.  Mongolia was
a horse culture, and everything from family to trade was conducted on the back
of horses. Horses that moved faster than people.

A medieval army (and indeed ancient and classical) basically moved at human
walking pace. And as the
head of a column had to make camp till the rear caught up, generally 10 miles a
day was a *good* pace for much of human history.  Cavalry could move quickly,
but the whole army was limited to the speed of its slowest walker.

Mongols would (as would all cavalary in history) have multiple mounts, and could
change to keep them fresh. And this horse based steppe culture, lived entirely
in the saddle they basically *all had a horse*, and so they moved at horse pace.

Everything in an `aravt` was on horseback - tents, weapons, food and utensils.
SO the whole army could travel - usually 50-60 miles per day.  During Subotai's
raids on Eastern Europe, the `Rus`, the Hungarians, the Bulgarians and others
were devastated as they tried to catch an army of 90,000 that could travel in a
day what they could only manage in a week.

Of course European armies had horses, indeed European cavalry out-matched
Mongolian light cavalry, weight for weight, armour for armour - but the *rest of
the European army* was on foot or in a cart, and so the army
could only move at the pace of the walking foot soldier.  But the Mongols, their
whole army could move at the medieval equivalent of supersonic travel (See
www.acoup.blog [#02]_). As medieval communication was almost totally based on messages passed on foot, 
the Mongol Army moved faster than the news of their passing.

A similar effect is found in modern (post WW1 and WWII) army developments.
The tank arrived too late in WWI to have much strategic impact, but the German
Blitzkrieg perfected in Spain, showed that fast *cavalry raids* would enable
strategic wins in Europe.  But even so the Panzer divisions often exceeded their own supply lines.
Todays "top tier" armies are hugely expensive to maintain, because once you have
a tank, you need to put the fuel, ammunition, food, cooks, mechanics, and
everything else in vehicles that can move along lines close to tanks, and
importantly are not easy to kill (there is a sort of tiering of armour, from
vehicles on the battlefield to vehicles carrying the ovens. But they all need to
move, and all need to at least provide some protection) 

(This got notably worse with airpower, with Vietnam being perhaps the height of
"put everything into a helicopter", but the logistics for that became too
unwieldy, or perhaps too costly.  And its an open question if that same failure
for helicopters is a indicatgor for electric vehicles.  There just are not any
viable commerical 16-wheeler lorries, because the electirc battery equivalent of
the rocket equation hurts quite quickly.  And its not clear if the electric tank
can be a real thing.  If not, then sustaining a petrol driven army when the
industrial base is moving to electric looks tricky.)

Just like Gengis Khan the WWII and post WWII planners saw advantages in speed,
and the need to make everything *mobile*.

Steve Jobs dexcribed computers as bicycles of mind.  I desribe software as
literacy. I conjecture there are huge adavtages in speed and agility in running
software.

We are at the "oh look tanks work well" stage.  How we transition companies and
organistions to the "oh everything needs to be mobile now" is one of the
fundamental themese of this book.

Everyone is able to communicate via softwre, to read the code and understand what is
going on. Not have to be slowed down by translations into and out of policy
documents. And be shackled by lack of testing and modelling.

Some people think AI will magivally do this for us. One of my conjectures is "If
you think AI can magically solve your business problems tomorrow, you can solve
them today with software and determination."



Literacy is fundamentally Explicit, Introspectable and tends towards Open

The next few decades or more will belong to software literate the way the past
few centuries belonged to those who could read and write.  

* the software literate company (what WaPo looks to a
medieivle scrptorem) (literate best practise / the dev manual)

* The programmable company - splitting up working in the company and on the
company. Change control etc etc.
We dont need managers, we need editors.
OODA loop and testing and modelling and preproduction

* Policy, process, control - Deep state, introspection, software governance
  Heading towards democracys
  TOtalitarian bet on programmable company, and the democratic bet

* coders are new managers

* AI tomorrow, software todays

* disaggregating mgmt

* journalism and training data



we are moving from physicla. to cirtual
we are writing out how our workd works - to make it explicit and manipulate 
expand this 


software as Eunachs - eunachs goven powrr in rime or byzantium 
so that emperors did not need to worry that bureaucracy woukd be captured by "barons"
But european industrial state has dofferent needs - movement towards wealth gathering 

Software Literacy
-----------------

The idea we should treat software as a new form of *literacy*, 
                                and the implications on a societal scale of everyone being as skilled in 
                                software as they are at reading, writing and arithmetic.

Software is a form of literacy
-------------------------

Software as form of loteracy
Also a encodingnof the policies and
processes of the organisation that created it
Software guides, does crimes, but most importantlyit is explicit

this means all organisational polcoes are explict and doscvoerable and 
this opens orgnaiations in ways inimaginable before

having all policies directly connected to realmworld enabkes 
faster feedback, modelling etc

but it comes at cost of openness

we kight win 

this is a doscsussio. 



Software as a form of literacy, a way of taising 
the political into the explicit

testable organisation - External to team is owned automateabke testing milestones -> probably fitness style or cucumber style but the point is some form of policy that is enforced by engine 

In fact that’s everything Inthink - software is literacy expressing policy implementation- that is this is how this org thinks


Agile fails because the ret of the org is not buying intonit 
- obvious answer is no deadlines till its all deadlines

but how do we change the rest if the org - we subsume it into software
so that becomes gove us the milestones
and we build a new org that is software depenandt (thisnis software wating the world

and this new org is repacing the old (its inecitable£
mbut demands defining the policy of the org in software terms (see do crime for VW)

thats how to buikd teating regience

but once do that you have a model and can speed up chnage

testable organisation
wxplicit policies
programmable policies 
modellable and predicatable company
iteration speed 


its not science or even engineering 
its literate expression of human organisation
or a written executable process (lets call it 90%)



We are reshaping the world by making it explict, introspectable, open.
[expand on explicit (written down), introspectable (not low-code), open(totalitarian bet)]

There are enormous implications.  Similarly in history we have chosen to become
urban dwellers, agricutrlists,and now knowledge workers and organisers at scale

Arranging the world to be iterated over.
----------------------------------------

  (joke about google destroying what it cannot index) BUt this is also true -
  we did lose pre-industrial society.
  Lessons about how to live togetehr were lost (beware rose coloured glasses and abuse)
  Historical sweep important, industrial world only 250 years old, (1776 story).
  We have lost freedoms and gained a new world - but it is unstoppable. We live in unsustainable
  world and our only hope is onwards.  Software helps organise at scale - but *trust* matters.
  Organise at scale, but organise openly to encourage trust, esp when it gets difficult.
  Yes the system is rigged (Trump debate, darkness by design, but mortgage redlines and martgage credit ratings, the need to type in "do crime" in VW code).  Software is the system, so you can read the rules.  If the rules are "chinese communist party is in charge" then its harder, but humans value fairness beyond almost all (monkey experiment)

Journalism as training data for society
--------------------------------------- 

LLM as representation of "our" culture (see where western culture came from - 1776)
  Journlism as training data for LLMS - but by extension training data for our culture.#
  Google search is being repalced by LLMs. WHo controls the LLM access, which training corpus is used, which fine tuning. this matters. But only as a snapshot into "normcore".
  But it is the representation of our culture - and it fits on a laptop.
  Texas textbooks - what we teach our young, what is our culture, these matter 
  See mickey mouse and solar system.  POV is worth 80 IQ points.  By not giving kids the right PoVfrom the start we dont prevent them discovering for them selves - we just make it harder.

* Autism and rules
  software can represent, enfource, encourage, discover, speed up rules.
  But rules that are written dwn threaten priviledge
  This antognism will be paramount for future.  Piketty - can we beat him down?
  Can we over come priviledge? SEC approach - legistlate priviledge into being good. But leave them enough to make it worth thier while? THreat of digital currency. The example of cryptocurrency as why we have regulatioon and crime (see Sherlock holmes stories about bank failures)

autism and rukes
- fristrationnof bureaucracy and lack of what rukes and where to look
it empowers thise innpower, but rikes take away power and priviledge 

software is operationalmrules - the advantages outweigh cost of openness
esp when closed approach goves priviledge

improving organistions
----------------------

  COders are new managers
  Management - model, monitor, mentor, maintain. Mgmt is being disaggregated.
  Maintainence of org is in two parts - cultural (our values) - Post office scandal for pathology.
  Also maintenacne of large orgs as theory of firm - both contracting cost and treasury. Shared treasury is oncredibly valuable - see smoothed cashflows in corporate world.
  Two orders - do the work or cause it to be done or provide funding - where do they shade into each other.  They do this within orgs - how projects are really done, constanct hustle for new things.
  Mgmt as economist articles. But if software encoding is more detailed? THis si where LLMs replace mgmt - by being able to simulae and predict more effectively than manabement.

modern feudalism -> giving bonuses 
and budgets to those who support the CEO is clearest 
example of (Iron law bureaucrats)
democracy tends to defeat that asbribimg everyone temfs often 
to mean taking the cou
tse benfit everyone (see theory of EU inestment 
and voting spain not bote for knights of hungary)





management by shouting at underlings is 
a search for systems to deal with problems
that just occured. maybe effocectoce but there clearlywill
be better ways - but not in a tourney 

Organising at scale
-------------------

  But we do need to identify the problem, identify a solution, do the solution.
  Nudges wont work.  Its too short a time scale to do it thorugh education

organisation - just gove cash to local communities
isnt that similar argument to just employ people and let them 

But openly modelling, providing literate solutions so people can read what and
why they are guided.

This will help.
But not everyone

But toll is mental health issues that manifest in a urban buttoned down world.
But we have been given less freedom

JOurnalism
-----------

  Journalism is the training data for society - see weights and lawsuit from New York Times
  Also see LLms are search across our societies knowledge (and cultural norms)

  How has google search been replaced - by LLM

  But what is was trained on matters - we need to see the “canon” and try to
  avoid the SEO poisoning of the well - that LLM training data and weights
  likely to be determined by government as it is likely to be the teaching
  assistant for future 

  And we want to define that in same way we define the textbooks 



Software is disaggregating management 
--------------------------------------

so what does mgmt do and what is software edisrupting

mgmt - model monotor mentor but mostly ensure continuation of org
when mission conflixts with org survival have pathologies

devmanual - tech lead as director of movie - setting stnadrds and color charts 

management - you do the work or you cause it to be done ... in your taste
workers do the work like canermen or set builders
the director ensures it is done to his or her taste. their colour oallette their speed and clarity
their ability to ensure others understand their taste ensures the outcome will be coherent

anything above this, anything that does not affect taste is finance

the banker might talk loudly about how he made the film possibke and the notes he gave - but thats crap
its just money

what we need is to understand where the lines are deawn 

Most managemers esp at fonance level have "economist pundit" levelnof understanding
not wrong but not testabke either

a software model however is testsble - and a virtual model of the business is onenofnthe most valuabke items we willmoriduce 

the meaning of culture
----------------------
"nurtured bias" 
"what my grandmother taught me"
"what the village thatbraised me taught me"
the uncritical thinking that majority of people will show
- see the seaweed icecream issue
