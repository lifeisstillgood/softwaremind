The Code is The Design
======================

Back in the the autumn of 1992, Jack W Reeves published an essay in C++ Journal, entitled "What is SOftware Design?".

Real software runs on computers. It is a sequence of ones and zeros that is stored on some magnetic media. It is not a program listing in C++ (or any other programming language).
A program listing is a document that represents a software design. Compilers and linkers actually build software designs.

#The essence boils down to 'when you have cod the final design is done. there is no lernative extra work done. it is mechanical determinism from that point.  so anything before writing code is just artists drawings..

design and test
designing is massively iterative process
experience teaches us how to avoid some of worst self inflicted errors, but engineering gets us tighter

my takeaways are the organisational design, is vitally important to accepting the process of software design. it is iterative, it should be many laywered.\

I objext to locode solutions because i see them as 1Dimensional.

He definitley foresees the agile revolution.
(work on that too)

Agile has mostly fallen - its hard to say when almsot every maor company pays lipservice.

But the issues laid out by reeves, that give words to experience of every software developer, are still prevalent - and they are not technical in nature. They are organisational, and by my POV ???they are due to lack of softwre literacy.  We would barely expect ublishing houses to have 


>>> Designing software is an exercise in managing complexity. The complexity exists within the software design itself, within the software organization of the company, and within the industry as a whole.

Robot built house - impact on architects

Inherent comploexity, organisation complexity, standards complexity 


Implications: it is cheaper and sinpler to build it and test than almost anything else 

He completely forseea and argues for the agile approach (better defijing the waterfall as eachbstage frozen before next)  

it also shows the isea of QA (quality analysis) as wrong headed - QA uses certain standards to reject one of the many widgets rolling off the lien as substandard - but aoftware rolls off and is an exact copy each time.  whats there it QA? 

This is just testing - and there is no point manually testing (other than a Mumbai jobs program) but there is value on designing upfrotn testinf
