There is not a software supply chain,
it is a found things agglomeration 

we are not paying for FOSS - https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/
in my head yes it is noce to fox this but this presents a fundamental challenge to *capitalism*
or whatever the modern day thing is.

i have worked for foss but i have not done as much as Inwould like because inlike feeding my kids more than inlike coding and Inlike coding a lot

security
--------
We talk about mechanisation of military (cavalry -> oil based transport)
also mechanisationnof society

but we need to talk about cyber security of society
see drones and area radio deniability (drones and remote control)

just as each radio must have encruotion and frwquency cycling 
and somehow keep that going day after day so every radio has it
ie that old transport plane needs upgrading

so must we donsame for hardware supply chain 
and software supply chain

and look at ransomare - that has social implicatiosn and the answer is basically upgrading tech
- and there will be w freerider benefot
