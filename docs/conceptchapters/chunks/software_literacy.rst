Software literacy
=================


it's not like engineering or science - it's not a science
(algorithms are but that's not most computer programmaubg(

it's not engineering like building an aqueduct abs people benefit from it by getting clean water or getting tweets

it's liteeacy in that most people will read and write abs will benefit directly in their gooddaily lives, abs that there will be second order benefits to all society that's
we can barely believe right now

but we have the historical precedent of literacy to guide us

And to get those before we need to build new structures and institutions and practise a - like libraries (see google is dying) 



(usual intro) then 

Another introduction
--------------------

This book is based around a single axiom : That computer software is a new form of literacy.  I want you, dear reader, to accept this as it is the basis for all going forward.  It is a little hard to take such things on faith, but a few nudges might help.

Firstly one that threw me completely- did you know that the walls of Jericho were thirty feet high almost 2000 years before writing was invented?  You see writing is a form of technology - it needed to be invented, supported.  Humans were building structures, humans were *engineering* walls, and building machines to help undermine or assault those walls) for 20 centuries before 
they thought to write about it.

Secondly, 

we already have AI - the crowd, the group, the organisation, the state - it's just slow and hard to introspect



Software development 
--------------------

I think writing is an excellent metaphor for software development 

- well defined outocomes 
"a novel"?
"a love story"
"chapter 13 needs to be about the break up"


this is not how we write stories - it might work for encyclopaedia but a book is a book not a collaborative work 

we don't have perfect metaphors - but we didn't for writing in 2000bc or even 0bc

Productivity debate
--------------------

finally software literacy solves for me one of the great economist conundrums - computers appear everywhere but in the productivity statistics - because we have succeeded in putting pen and paper on every desk, but barely anyone can read or write, and the libraries, bookshelves, letter service etc are woeful
