The explosion of software literacy.

- software is a new form of literacy

This book is based on a (reasonable) conjecture - that software is
best viewed as a new form of literacy.

This is ok - we can see the suprficial similarities - but its the
downstream impacts that are the most interesting, and more controversial.



Software Literacy and Second-order consequences
===============================================

- Everything is run by software - and software illiteracy will be as debilitating to people, compnaies and socoeotes as language illiteracy




- coders are the new managers 
(the typing pool takes over the Boardroom)

- double down on democracy
(if the machines do as they are told, who needs slaves?)
Chinas totalitarian bet

- but that implies more aharing of wealth 
Sharing? Why this form of capitalism

- corruption and corrusion in organisations - its everywhere
Is capitalism eveworking? All profits went to traders.

corrupt
corroded
cononerate

loss of foxus

secondary conjectures and implications
--------------------------

Lo-code and No-code is a joke

The virtual world makes measuring the real world possible, and at
greater detail than we imagine

The social media furire is really one of sudden access to data - like
London pea souper cleqring out

conversations online are terrible - but they were offline we just coukd ignore it.

online reviews. Yiur friendss will happily abuse your friendship to make a profot offline (see tipperware parties and all pyramid schemes)

The digital mirror
------------------

The virtiak world is reflecting back on us our world and at vaster scale - and the problems we see are ones of degree not quality - they always existed we were just not dealing with it

Think of it as civil roghts era.

We shall see this thoroughout as we find industries and unfairness that is revealed and we have to decide what if anything to do about it

my take is in the end we all want to moce to fairer workd - and we shall. advice is donthe radical now because in thirty years it will be obvious 

digital activity leaves nonwheee to hide.

important thing is to focus eegukation on the real menaingful thing.
Freedom?

Chinese totalitarian bet - our bet is on freedom through respectful
politelness



coders are new managers 
-----------------------

Look at Peter Dricker and the google eight rules.  what a bunch of pussies


- software is used to *run* companies day to day (algo trading is affecting liquidity ?)

- so compnaies are basically versioned - coders are new managers. managers were building a compnay deisnging its processes 

- not remore working but async working

- loans as example - now decision is based on credit score.  this is not a hige difference from chinees social score (its whatvis unofficially kept anyway)

- Biggest implication is trolley problem. We will have to decide (and decide hiw ti decide) all thise horrivle edge cases.  This will get nasty in democeacy, especially as people will try and use code in politics

- we will see many issues currntly seen in crypto - what oracle do we use to trigger some situation in code? how do we habdle the "oh we did not mean that" problem 

- ooen source society (segue to society)




The software mind is the meta mind of annorganisation  - hownit thinos (slow fast AI) and how that chnages in a world of software literacy



Neuromancer and Demon internet - the cirtualmconnecting to the physical - this is the dream but it is also a noghtmare of control - the current beneficiaries and managers are due to lose out 

there is no such thing as a free market / software socialism - the virtual workd measures and raises to a level of visibility - thisnwill disrupt corruption and corrosion (in companies and leseqhere )


Softeare and ghe paved road
--------/---------------///
https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/06/paved-paas-netflix/

Within the Netflix technical stack, functionality provided by the PaaS includes microservice Remote Procedure Calling (RPC), service discovery and registration, operating system, application runtime, configuration, metrics, logging, tracing, dashboards, alerts and stream processing.

At some point you need these as business building blocls - cloud is not servrrs its services thst worl in sensble ways - ifs not putting saas togethe rwoth ifttt its codijg reql apis and real data. it feels different 

90% of it will looknlike from people import person - select all persons with contract > 1 year

This is viaion of fitute company - all the siloed functions of company (hr, finance, etc) and access to roam across then. jupyer notevook style


leadership
----------
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Dowding

"""Beyond the critical importance of the overall system of integrated air defence which he had developed for Fighter Command, his major contribution was to marshal resources behind the scenes (including replacement aircraft and air crew) and to maintain a significant fighter reserve, while leaving his subordinate commanders' hands largely free to run the battle in detail."""

Changes in compmaies
--------------------

- Project management 
Project management is promarily programme mgmt - co-ordination between different projects. Its not some clever methodology that will make the current single project magically work better.  You can do that with a decent todo list (hence joel spolsky)

The provlem is co-ordinating between projects to a oid catastrpphe - see the thing abiut tubnel under airprirt that was too small

You *could* donthis by careful planning - but in software world its simpler easier more eliable to write tests and stuc out - this explains growthbof mixroservices (which match bausiness functions)

expand to inclide - large baujess taxonomies and service mapping (shoukdnbe managing 1000s of movroservoces

so a companu that cannot introspect its current state is goign to need project mgmt - but onbthat can, can test next state releases and so on can make progress - without prject mgm - and that is proceless



Micro sevices - stop trying to control it in one persons head - the abstractions are too large to be useful 
 microservices show the actual useful units if process / acticity - and are hiw business should arenage itself 
 
 and they need to be manages not woth "thats bobs area" bur with groahviz ans software 
 - need to become software literate 



Democracy
---------
https://polite.technology/preview

https://www.nceo.org/article/research-employee-ownership

I think that the arreival of voting on features will transform the democracy of companies - if we all vote we all have reaource allocation control (so some peoplee get more votes - thats going to be interesting)  but alos whomundersrand the implixations

this requires discussion 
and likely micro services 

Content moderation ans Robert E Lee
----------------------
We are aearching for the glovally acceptable minimum set of content guidelines

Its goin to be tough - but it will need to be coherent - enough to write rules and not use AI!

We are aeeing re-evaluation of confederare symbols - they were rebels after all - and one of those global minimums is likely to be equality before the law.  

the most likely global miminum is un human rughts declration

then content moderation stops and younsimply become a punlisher - why bother moderating content - if yiu are selecting contrnt to show over other content that makes yiu .. a publisher? 


conclusion
----------
We will see a new mind. Faster
fairer
if we xhoose tonnake it so

we worrybabout democracy backsliding - but I thinknit has a bright fuutre (70 ywars old) and software, freely abailableninformation and the correct labelling of sata for the Slow AI of society will lead to a gloriuos future

howeber apple CSAM mechnaism (homomorphic encroyion on client) was unable to over come "privcy" concerns because its nit about someone knowing what i have on my machine, its about doing something with it
- the ohone in my hand scanned me and then did something i dont like. even if it dis not "tell" anyone
- it still did it

the solutionnhere is medical levels - in the best interesrs if the citizen (woth few exceptions such as CSAm)

- mgmt is primeuly doing the snall admin fixes that adjust trim and keep thinngs going on (acccounts call it xx mgmt)
- 

mgmt can be seen as husthaving extea oeople lokiing around

but they need ti raise the alarm / persuafe the body to take action.  vutrnetly thisbis topndown (hence politics hence cirruption)
