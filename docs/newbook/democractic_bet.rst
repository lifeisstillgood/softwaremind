The Totalitarian Bet
====================


Totalitarian bet is also a bet 
on democracy (or western modern democracy)
How organisations decide
------------------------



It is a constant political ebb and glow of 
taking other peoples other "tribes" birepoints,
needs, weaknesses and gains and losses to 
evaluate what is or is not acceptablr
this is visibkeninnthing slike coujtires and shuttle diplomacy
but is part parcel of ebrry company decidingnonnits annual budget
reacting to a crisis ot opportunity
its why founder led companies react faster mutate wuickrr 
and also why pricate companies (dictatorships) react faster than governments
but sclerosis sets in
Can democracy help. only of eberone has equal share as well as equal say
then post office is avoided as thise with power are not 
model of trades unions likely to be model for mangenet as it disaggregates 
elwcted off ials and move towards worker "juries" to recommedn hard choices
see executives as working at the 2(O)) boujdaries 
Future Trends
=============



Guessing future trends is a much discredited literay trend,
and I am not going to fix that. but one of the ways to avoid foolishness is
to identify not some new trend but the biggest longest trends and
assume they are jmoortant
ao what are the biggest longest trnds of the last centiry,
and how dis they impact western democracy (amd so the software world we lice in)
* biggest by far is energy (oil) - ie biggesy reaource pump
* pikkety blip - far and away most sognficiat reaource allocation issue
* impact of mass education 
* impact of mass communication (broadcast and peer to peer)
so i am going to do some Turchin style predictions here 
Energy is over. we have to handle the climate change
 (its not going to be reversed, its going to be mitigation, mass movement)
Mass education is here to stay, we are even getting to school
leaving age 21
mass communication here to stay
so what is going to chnage western democracues ?
reaource allocation - the reversion to kean of uber wealthy holding all wealth
but wealthy will face the thrash back of 
So holding the line on one thing, reduced wealth inequality 
seems the best long term bet. and investing in improving energy 
usage (but it seems we are throwing a lot at that one anywya.)
also - as infrastructre becomes balkanised
we see increased spend on maintenance but also changes jow 
architecture and town olanning work - more checksums, more ledgers and more centrakised / democtatic / legal control iver ledgers and lefger changes
less darkness by design - because risk of politibsl control we dont agrre with - eu vs usa disagreements will allow for eu market approach

Democractic Bet
---------------


That openness leads to better outcomes. Studies on agile in orgs. Military behaviour.
                           Democarcy is waaay newer than we think. And I think tied heavily to scientic method.
All the big wind have gone 
- steam coal electricity electronics, medicine and public health
still huge stirdes neede but what we need now is consolidation of the wins not tremendous growth
democracy, equality and openness - to srave off r> i

beware of viewing geopolicis as a civilisationalmclash - most civilisations want the beat for citizens (and elite)
chapters in software literacy 
- 
tickets are not the best / right way to forward plan -> see moving work from team to team in devops handbook
the work is creative not operational
(i mean operational is fine but that means  you just have not automated it yet) 
leadership as form of terrorism or protection racket - I could blow up your whole company create toxic cultures - but I won't so please pay me 
=======================



Equal Say, Equal Share
=======================


The point is FDR was a traitor to his class.  And that he understood something that is
rarely accepted in political circles.  An equal say means an equal share.  And if the
answer is 'the plebs only get a say once every four years and the elite get a say every
day, look at what explicit implicit and openness directionality means.  There is only so
long people can put up with Dark Pools - isnt there?
Productivity - the key?
-----------------------


Many economists today bemoan lack of productivity growth
as a major reason for economic failings.  As an example
in UK wages have not risen since 2008 crash.  If we had enjoyed growthbrates similar to
1990-2005
or much of post war period UK worker average wage would be 10,000 GBP better off.
Thats a huge number
Now
we see computers everywhere but in the productivity numbers
Conjecture: The virtual-irl link, software / reality gap
can be bridged by software literacy in many cases (having people able to read and write,
plus aoftware that is deaigned for onward use (topless) plus
greater reach of software (sensors, actuators) will provide productivity chnages.
Most enterprises are largely over staffed - so why arent they culled??
Because most enterprises are not staffed by fools ...
well
conjecture on the theory of the firm -
- lack of insight into internal
process - ie deep state and lack automation
- the faikure of large plans - it is ventire captial
and people kind of knownot - but ahoukd embrace that majority of venture captial
is spent internally not externally.  traditional VC only gets the truly disruotive
companies - thatvwill destroy intentql homeostatis of
companies - and most companies dont face existential threats which is why silicon valley
is mostly unique - its more schumpter than the test rather than the wearher
- shared treasiry leada to funding multiple other bets
- programme mgmt isnmostly about intenal VC mgmt - and worse using politics ans not
metrics like teaction
==========================


You cannot escape openness
==========================


Bitcoin, ledgers, banking
Ledgers will be GPS of financial servixes - letting everyone know exactly what is where
this will devastate traditional banking !
Implicit is now Explicit
========================


PArt of architects paradox - enforced openness is the desitnation
oss4gov.org
Why shoukd proprietary software be used by a single payer?
the idea of outsourcing is to turn to someone with more expeirence of running a sevice -
but if you are a government there is no one more expeirenced
hence the avility of many garbage collection services
markets docide into two structures - those with low transaction costs (see below)
that naturally tend towards compeition and so stable
and thise that can be exploited

Openness ruins all of this exploitatio.
fits in one head
Project Oberon and an organisation ERP
it should be possible to have onne ERP ans one set of languge
APIs and that it can. all fit in one head
NOt that complex conjecture
most organisations are not that complex - but the faikire of openness
and the complexity of deciding what to do next is the complexity

Enforced Openness
-----------------


We are leading up to the Totalitarian Bet, but its worth noting how VW emissions
        is clear in the codebase.  Its not quite like LIBOR scandal where if there had not
been texts explaining "we are going to do a crime" then there simply would have been no
proof.  This is where the code base told the Slow AI, the deep state of VW, told the whole
org, how to behave. criminally.
=================



Socialist utopia
=================


WE live in one. We are dependanet on people we simply dont know. Terry pratchett quote
about big lies like truth justice. Other lie is that people will trade without trust.
People will self harm without knowing a way back.  Northern Ireland is as good as it gets.
 HOw do we build trust in societies and in organisations?
============================



Super Co-operative Species
============================


The idea humanity is so successful because we are super- co-opearive,
                                         beyond simply working with family or local tribe,
we have discovered
                                         specialisation, trade and the enormous benefits
of being oragnised beyond
                                         our immediate tribal groupings.  ANt colonies are
amazing, but where is the inter-colony trade?
Whats the different between super co-operative and scoialism?
=================================================================



The Totalitarian Bet, The democratic bet and wealth taxes
=================================================================



* totalitarian bet
lo-code is rubbish but learnign curve huge
developer tools are really litersacy tools
software will not only control the companies we work in (policy enforcement snd
impenetaiotn) but will shape how we cahnge said policies - through democracy and
through modelling - policits exists but will shift to more open and more model driven.
We hope - thsts the totalitarian bet
chapter:Feudalism, Democracy, Wealth Tax
========================================


* democracy in companyes as orgnsityiona change
  Why should those employees control those - but they already do, itâ€™s just internal
politics, bribery
politics will not end, but democracy will change politics of elite in and out of orgs
Jp Morgan was a democratising force just like FDR using the mass of people to push aside
old feudal elites (and make new ones natch)
Chapter: MMT, Crypto, Equality, Democracy
=========================================


class war: https://billmitchell.org/blog/?p=61635
chapter - MMT, class war, wealth tax, crypto
my take is MMt is right about basics
that itnis about abolity tonput reaources if a nation / society to bear
Notth korea has one approach
the state droven is another (soviet)
Capitalism is another - elite driven
but democracy is another
democracy and capitalism are not synonymous
dutch in 1700s used financial methods to align
resources - as did banknof england
its leas clear where and how thise resources can be directed
financially - esp when much finance is derivative
or betting on other outcomes instead of focused on
using resources
how do we use resources - fiat crypto will likely end
banks ability to create money sonwill affect ability for koneybcrwation to reflect
real reaiurces
so what will? whomwill dorect more nurses
- equality and infrastructure  is the issue. if we were all equal, all capital holders,
all labour and all consumers
then infrasturcutre would drive agglomeration - or rather itnwould be easier to move
cities due to
climate chnage - or would it - the built environment?
Totalitarian Bet

We have 150 years apart two scandals of adukterated milk
One killing 8000, one killing 4.  the difference? Ability if people
to koin together to monitor to agitate - something like communication
without something?
From guy in guardian. Essence is that China is betting that it can control its citizens
using monitoring and social pressure.  Now worth talking about racist assumptions - china
has a hugely strong culture of familial devotion and respect built in, so this is not like
trying to monitor norweigans or Montana.
       But it is also a totalitarian regieme using reeducaton camps against racial
minority. SO its not nice.
       The problem is two fold.
       1. This is how society does work.
       2. But its how society decides what is acceptble, what is to be pubished and what
not.
       3. this is culture wars.  Is it ok for gay marriage.  My 7yo daughter knows most of
the words to Katy Perrys; I kissed a girl (cherry chopsticks!)
       It will work in reducing open dissent. But will it work in actaually changing
minds.
