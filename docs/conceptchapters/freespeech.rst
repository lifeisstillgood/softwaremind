This is a issue of *public order*.  If some idiot stands on a street corner and performs an anti-social act (varies based on jurisdiction, location, weather, gender, who is likely to be watching) then a state actor (the local beat cop) takes some action.

If they do the same in a pub / bar then the bar owner takes some action, with the implicit or explicit help of same state actor earlier.

If a printer / publisher receives an anti-social act in writing (hmm, harder to imagine but ok.  Holocaust denial in Berlin ? 

Now we move to an online location - a platform.

Look this must be pretty obvious surely? 

actually no - defining what is anti-social is hard and almost impossible to move globally.  we will probably see balkanisation based around language first.  which will lean heavily on jurisdiction

 
Publisher vs comkon carrier
---------------------------
If twitter / Fb etc was just a common carrier then you coukd no more hokd themnresponsibke formme saying hotriblenthings or planning a mutder on thenphone 

but they sont just pass on my worss. they provide *discovery* through algorithn - they highlight some messages to others - that is publishing ? 

Aldo the whole cancel cukture.  some people think that there is a curtailing of free speech. people are not allwoed to saybsomething. somethings are being made unsayable.

well, no. 

1. every group has social norms - what is and is not acceptable.  but the group just went from small isolated grouos (younand your friends, people whomwatch newsnifht) to - wveryone on the planet who soeaks english.

and this muchnlarger grouo now needs to work out its social norms.

some fundamental understandings of free soeech is going to be oart if that - but curtailed by what is necesaary for social survival / cohesion

some one saying x should be raped is kindnof free speech but is also kind of something that ruins everyones day. 

the thing about content moderation is pretty much the worst is out there and almaot everyone when oresented woth it will go, yeah lets ban that. 

rate limiting is likely yo be the best solution tonthis - but that might not be whole solution

denocracy and stuff
-------------------
Every authoritarian dictator isnin some form of democracy - its looking for the goldilocks zone that matters - where scientific orogress can continue and social fairness allows the wealth to spread

continuum of totalitaian dictatorship and anarchy but at right angles social fairness - inside that cube is a zone of scientific orofres and wealth creatuon

- the social norms play huge oart - for exmaole how scientific debate is conducted.  in ankecture hall a professor attacking a post grad on social grounds is awful - see lysenko https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko

so the social norms we are fighting for today are not absolutist but have need of a feedback function (shared wealth?) and cannot be "free speech or die"




Philosophy 
Marx defines production as important part of industrial society

what is software society going to be defined through - being on time as a worker is unlikely to remain as a necessary behaviour

what else is going to change? (delver into marx suoerstructure)


Political economy:

Closely tied to distributors is software idea of many smaller items - flocks - idealism i'd open source co operative businesses 

Content Moderation - the problem is not what we think it is 
----------------------

Major points
- How does page rank work 
- really all FAANG is doing is watching our behaviour in ways never possible before - the value lies in the data provided by human behaviour
- if data created by us is actually owlur property and legal presumption about its transferability is changed then most of value of these huge corps goes away

- we need to see a new legal environment - with those changes 

- my activity on and offline is valuable - but not to simply
make me a target for another sale 
(pet peeve - tv menus - loads first into "buy now" not "watch what you already have")

- scale is huge confounding issue

- but scale does not change essence

- this is personal data ownership

- The OS of social media is really the behaviour of humans - the So called AI will go where the data points tell it and we produce the data points - so the bugs in the new OS are bugs in human cognition.

Hence we need regulation to tell the AI what it should do when the data leads it astray - see software that won't hire women because they don't get promoted at this company

So now we are back to the old problem - what kind of society do we want to build.  Software won't help us choose.

but it can help us objectively measure 

Which leads to MOOPs and data sharing etc

We can find the ideals - and be guided by the experience of millions of precious.  

The wisdom of the crowds can span the ages now - the wisdom of the crowds will be found by following / choosing the curation of millions of people who turned out like us - be like your hero.



We have situations  where major tech companies have got gatekeepers - see https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/another-podcast/id1535359773?i=1000497717518

Listen to ben evans on content moderation 

- coties accept certain levels of crime / drug laws adjust what is crime - but we cannot eliminate 

so sme for 

but different crimes 

Society still needs to define what is acceptable
- the history and development of cities - new layouts, improved social areas (building churches)

So we need more tent pole events inline - more I Loce Lucy 

We have a scaling problem now - all scientists alive now more than have ever lived since 1980


Social Media and unscripted interactions
--------------------------

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26439952

So much of social media is guided by / influenced by profit or proselytism 

Some places remain possible to escape - peer to peer like whatsapp - but that has copy paste etc

Essentially one should look for .. friends 


The adtech and privacy issue

Privacy: the long answer
------------------------

Much longer:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26799327

1. It is a privative - it is like a hole it does not exist. (see also identity)

2. At some point we will
lose anonymity online.  This is not terrible - we have very little anonymity IRL (basically we are anonymous to our fellow train passengers, and bad behaviour on street often reflects that).

It's almost certain to become something like a social credit score.  We shall enforce social behaviours somehow - at the moment we do it with a small town mentality - you break some level of social rules, you get banned

the downsides of this are huge - so we will need some serious regulations on this - as well as methods to escalate.  But we need to be able to deal with this really effectively and quickly - and this only works with "user moderation" - ie a jury.  And we can easily imagine online juries to decide some hellbanning.  And if that works well ... why can't it work well for real justice system? And what is wrong with the justice system (basically underfunded)

Problems: Trolls have more free time than you do.  Wikis only work because the cost of a reversion is less than the cost of typing the crap.

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26796579

Problems : any form of user moderation will be poisoned by trolls or by a special interest group organising.  This happens inIRL politics.  online it is worse.  Only by having the whole community engage can they be outvoted (assuming they don't actually have majority support) 

So ... 

Problem: Social media problems are human cognitive issues - fake news preys on inciting outrage and people in bubbles thinking their experience references whole world. 

Advertising for disintermediates in time
----------------

it used to be show a
car advert to someone currently reading a car magazine

now i can show a car advert to someone who read a car magazine last week - and on a different (cheaper) property

we broke relationship between content providers and ad money 

Privacy abs transparency 
------------------------
if your data is used to decide your job application or education or legal sentence then those decisions need to become transparent - which implies the total end of corporate commercial confiedentiality - perfect markets !  smaller companies ! 

Let the police not the security services tackle digital realm.  Anyone with anything to hide will never make a digital move ever again - dead letters etc only 


But people do tweet stupid things 
--------------------------


https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27582145

We need more transparency - even in judging how others are reacting - 

Someone says something racist online.  This happens in pubs too.  We judge that person, and we also judge by the reactions of those in earshot.  but on twitter we cannot see the reactions of all those in earshot - just those who (angrily) reply.

So yes reads / downvotes vs actions will help. even amount of reaction (1-5 downvotes)

this is the market structure of online discourse.

Complete HN rant from me on this
----------------------
This is about free speech which is about content moderation which is really about the dividing line between what tech can do and what society can do to shape its citizens and what should be left to individual (informed) choice

Twitter labelled Trump tweets as bullshit (misinformation).  They were still shared - but dropped by 20% - somlabelling does work

Unionise and democratise
------------------------
I love the Guardian - a beacon of journalistic integrity even if I don't agree with everything it says.

I love Neal Stephenson - The Diamond Age is one of my youths defining books (as I suspect it is for the new owners of the ocean liner)

But one is a fictional book twenty years old, and one is a newspaper at its best reporting on real problems right now, not imagined problems in the future

Seasteading is a joke,  and despite all the cool cyberpunks, we are not going to become 'phyles and tribes.  Geography and demographics are still our destiny for the next few centuries.

(Amazon passed some kind of event horizon - 1.3M employees makes it bigger than almost anything out there - armies etc.  The thought of being head of HR for amazon flat out terrifies me. And this means we can find any amount of abuse in Amazon if we look hard enough.)

Are there better ways for Bezos to spend all the money he got - in my view yes.

If enough people like me agree we can do this democracy thing and tax it away from him and into better places.

But the problem  is  not billionaires or seasteading.

The problem is sensible democratic action.  The problem is regulation (the 2020s call to arms)

Write your congressman.

Edit:

Uncalled-for Advice to the Head of HR at Amazon:

Unionise and Democratise

Firstly 1.3 *million* - that's an insane number of employees - Walmart and Mcdonald's might just outstrip you, but I would  not look to them for guidance - look at Indian Railways or the US military.  At this sort of size Amazon will be a "safe place to work".  Mothers will start to advise their sons to take work there because it's too big to fail.  You know that's not true but you need to avoid large scale resentment - and that starts with employee welfare - and welfare starts with feeling they have support against the the man - unions.

Yes they will make life harder - but you have fine from startup to being your own government - people will expect to spend their working lives in Amazon like they do in Walmart or the DoD or railways. As such they can either be part of the decision making process and protected from abuse - or they can be abused and powerless and work less effectively for you and eventually cause so much bad press that your name is mud.

I guess you know all this - but democratising is not just unionising - I think it is coming - i think that companies are going to find it harder and harder to exist by fiat - that every decision will need to be published and publiscise 
like regulators do now - and this will lead to people wanting a say or a vote on such decisions - internal company referendums as it were.

Anyway ranting too much.



GeoPolitics and film studies

https://vimeo.com/238637906?ref=em-v-share

This video essay suggests there are theee sets of "stakes" that need to be in place for a great movie (ending) - external stakes (like getting the cash, or surviving the war), internal stakes like romantic love or self respect and philosophical stakes - a set of values versus another set of values

And this seems ... ok.  this seems natural abs human.

So what are the stakes between say .. axis and allied of ww2? of the cold war ? American respect for individual? America  economic ideals vs kleptomaniac?

What are the values at stake between west and china?

Is it reallly they are both capitalist societies anyway - that this is about who will take good and silver -  it a fight to the death  ? so should we worry less?
