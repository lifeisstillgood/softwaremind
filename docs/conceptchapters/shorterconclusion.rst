Putting the conclusion before the horse.
========================================

As a child, my History teacher, Mr Crowse, taught me "Say what you are
going to say, say it, and then say you said it.". Then over the years
essays gave way to trying to persuade through emails, or comment
threads.  My arguments got shorter, with people who knew most of the shorthand.
I had found getting to the point was getting in the way of
actually saying something.

Now my History teacher might not appreciate how much of mid-19th
Century politics I can still remember, but at least he will be happy
he had some impact all those years later.  Now, here is my conclusion,
in the wrong place, up the front of the book.

It's not a *philosophy*.  *Attitude* is too... well actually attitude is
pretty good. Yes, Attitude. The Software Mind is an *attitude*.  It is
an attitude formed from using, writing and reading code day in and day
out.  It is as ingrained in developers as literacy is ingrained in
"normal" people.

Imagine you woke up this morning and 98% of the world was illiterate -
literally had never picked up a book.  Oh they had *heard* of books
and thought people who could read were very, impressive, and got good
jobs, but no. Most people could not read a whole newspaper.

Imagine your own *attitude*.  It would be world changing. It is an
attitude about how a book should be arranged, with chapters and
character arcs and indexes.  And then an attitude about how
*libraries* should be arranged.  And an attitude then about, now we
have these books, and this body of knowledge that can help with
medicine and geography and such, about how companies should be
arranged, and then how society itself should be arranged. Written political manifestos ! Who'da thunk it?

You see the problem with this *attitude* is that it looks, from a
non-literate person's point of view, it looks very *uppity*. Having to
turn everything on its head just because its better from the point of
view of a *book*?  Sounds crazy.

Software Literacy is a real thing.  It is something we *all*, all
eight billion of us, should learn.  It is a thing that *demands* we
turn the world upside down just to realise the benefits of a software
literate world.  Becasue the last time we turned world upside down to
meet the needs of books, it turned out pretty well.

If I sound uppity throughout the book, there is a reason. 

There is a famous quote, or snark more accurately.

.. :: You see computers everywhere ... but in the priductivty statistics.

Its a fair comment.  Vast Multinational conglomerates spend vast sums
on technology - and yet barely improve their bottom lines.  I mean
most of the Fortune 500 spend *billions* each per year on
"technology", and benefits accrue, yes, but half those benefits come
from being able to say no to expense account padding.

Its not because software is not useful - its just not used well.

Here is a little story.  Around the turn of the 20th Century mass
elecgtrification was taking place across the modern world.  Houses
were being lit, searchlights sent out Bat signals, and factories were
buying in to the new hotness. Factories had been arranged around a central power source - the steam engine. Boilers and gears and belts ran from one efficient engine, and turned, rolled and lifted equipment in various dark corners.

The first wavve of electrification removed the big noisy engine, and replaced it with a big, quiet electric engine. But left the belts and power transmissions in place.  And no matter how hard they tried, companies saw electricity everywhere, except in the productivity statistics.

Eventually the promise of the electric motor, many, smaller distributed around as wanted to benefit the factory process, became the norm - Car companies like Ford lead the way to use electricity in new decentralised ways, and popularised the Assembly Line.  Heavy tools could now be placed next to banks of workers.



A progrmmale company is what you get when you ask a developer to
design a company

And what do you get when you design a society with (software) literacy
at its core?

Two visions: Dystopia and Utopia visions - police state and free
state.  Alwatys a good idea to choose utopia.  I am going to assume
humans will choose the utopia option.  At least in one part of the
world.  And it is likely to spread.


Software is eating the world - its not done yet.
But it is now "systemically important" and so will be regulated.
Software governance will play a part as the 13th Factor

From a western perspective, double down on what works - what has
driven the past two hundred years.  Transparency, democracy (have
another go in 4 years), - more democractic companies - less
exploitation (ie credit card rates as exloitation) - trust built in -
the greatest trust is in Science, and medicine.  how to replicate
medicoen trust is to replicate "first do no harm" - the wwelfare of
individual patient is paramount at all times.  This is freaking hard.

- project management is dead. Programmable companies are
  programmable. They dont need project management they need software
  developemnet life cycles. THis is the real success of Agile.

- fractal management - reporting on your own perfoemance - digital
  foot print analysis

- this will lead to early MOOPS - how to improve maangerial ineter
- personal comms FInally the capabiliteis good enough to lead to
- consumer use and psychologucal agents

- governance and simple and transaprent laws and code
  
- how we run companies will start to leak into how we run socieity
  - Wardley maps
  - models of economy and "our own facts"
  - fake news is just the shake out of "own facts"
  - 

- software and politics again is governace and shared osmosis

- coaseian dieal firm size - and regulations needed to change it (ie
  anti-trust laws allowing co-ordination)


- Trying to judge the essential and the incidental (prblems with pagerank, renting out your domain juice)

- software socualism and open source
  Open source seems most obvious
  Open hardware nash equlibrium
  Open source scandal like UK post office


- where have we moved the complexity - it is rare that we
remove complexity - we have it in people process or technology - and
where we choose to put it and manage it matters


- culture wars and Ok Boomer.
Brexit: trade agreements ante becoming more aligning regulations,
aligning culture.  Iphone is basically starting it from the other
side.


so the more our lives are represented in virtual the more we can
measure it and so harmonise it - so it's about being aware of the
importance and details of these dates - this is thus a good thing of
brexit

if beat intersts of patient is used as the goal then if we stop selling you to advertisers we then start selecting products based on best interests of the patient - in other words legal requirements to agent says only do what's in best interests of patient - so it becomes really hard to offer products that are exploitative - we build a "name of that podcast paternalistic something"


One culture to rule the world
credit suisse issue - yes racism but more importantly it's aristocracy not wanting to have problems on their doorstep - and that's about differences in culture being impossible to resolve without dealing with 

for example today's multi national companies have to internally deal with the problems - american bribery foreign act is impossible to use in UsA
we do business with saudi arabia in saudi normal practise -  but that's not acceptable in USA 

so they deal with it by .... and then the differences come up in a garden fight 

but we cannot keep hiding it in large internal
company culture - it becomes coasian - smaller companies more explicit- 

it's like cities - eventually they find a way to set what is normal - it tends to be unfriendly and formalised - but also accessible??? 
 
software enables  hoice of cultural differences - like regulation you need to have software compatible- like you have an option for "bribery"


Company size - do one thing well
