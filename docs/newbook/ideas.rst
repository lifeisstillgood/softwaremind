wrotignis natires way of ahowing howmlazy out rhingming is

software is gods way of ahowing how imprecise our writing is

software sharpens communication - removes all greyness
and somforces is to agree or dosagree not fudge

will make politiclamproblems worse or will rise this e 


products and protocols can be global 
(smartphones, teslas) but council by-laws
construction permits and solar panel land use
are - but thise can be more powerful

aligning that (ala EU) is our next societal challenge
(i mean thatvmeans ending war) 

Globalisation means harmonisation

New sensors allow new data industries

The ad twrgetting industry is just one
Most people are judging the value they get from smarphones,
amaozn delivieries and music back car alogies are worth the loss
of privacy.  they are mostly right because the consequences
of privaxy loss are lomited mostly to being served adverts.

the other feared consequences - loss of medical
cover, rediced access to financial services, insurance 
reduction and so on, are either heavily refulated
and bu fiat all people must bear the insurance cost (flooding a common exmaple)
or thise consequences are not widespread 


But we need to consider imapcts 

Others:

- roads will become the most heaviky monitored and 
imaged parts of human built areas - globally accurate milimetre perfect 
mapping of urban areas will be available. 
and extneding out from that is a matter of photo-grammetry.
At some point conveyancing will be transformed - i remeber a weeks delay in my forst house purchase 
when there was a half inch dosrepancy in council road plans 
twenty years apart.  I was less concerned about half an inch till it was pointed out that 
i might find my self unable to cross fromnthe public highway to mynown drivewaybwithout crossing a half inchnof someone elses land

it all was sorted out but any Tesla dricingndown the road would have mapped the keeb precisely
and kept photos.  

Is that Teslas property? is is a community service?

sensors make common areas introspectable
