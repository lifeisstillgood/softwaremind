Shape of future society
-----------------------

Firstly we can start with basics - 4biloikn smartphones we are all connected.  how does this shake out?
covid - we are not nations but one biosphere
- so are  atkins a useful idea? Common regulation - uber and amazon 
The EU and the african thing - future hope of society

But let's look at moop- it's where this stuff goes

but look at the obvious one - medicine. what lifestyle is most healthy.  This ooos an easy one - e felt look at Russia - life expectancy of 65 (pension age 66). Will the medical advice from epidemiology be "don't live under a mid-income dictatorship?"

the answer for western democracies - double down on democracy - look at EU look at thaler and libertarian xxx - look at sensible defaults - look at agents that actually work on our behalf 

MOOPs is the collection of data.

Agents acting in the best interests of user is the *advi e* based in the mass collection of data.

The next Larry Hagman in Dallas won't be actor pretending to be happy  - but will be a digital champagne socialist - sharing wealth of a country and not exploited by corporations and others - but aware and trading i off - the end of caveat emptor 



What's next

- how will the changes in tech (smartphone device, 
walk through all
 - legal / regulation - business model for tech - ) change the society (cities transport education etc)
 
 
- sensor collection and moop
- privacy vs who is allowed to use it for what purpose 
- what is facebook - it is ideal demographic breakdown machine 
- where will data be stored and where will code run and ow will the two be logged - this is basically the important part.  data colours

The open source quandary
------------------------
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25896351

- essentially OSS circumvents the gatekeeper of purchase orders - so we end up using code with odd licenses and no one knows when where (ie npm)

- redhat has the right approach and I expect this to expand - there will be curated open source companies supplying not just licensed code with verified supply chains but also expertise


 
 at least sensible second order effects
 
 Try and build sensible future landscapes and climates, and discuss software doctrine (dev manual)
 
purpose and leaders hip are weaker effects 
 
Technology changes everything over past two hundred years

cover 1815->2015 10% inversion, modern warfare etc etc

Pace of innovation is not slowing - just pace of discovery of great innovation

great innovations need great marketers - see fred tudor ice

Double down on democracy
------------------------

Brexit (putting wish fulfilment before facts / which textbooks you read as a schoolchild)

also internal politics of a company are almost entirely non-market (patronage society)
patronage bad way to run society - see "get colonised by the british"

Most companies internally are still in 1980s digital - and looking to advance - imagine a world where we say "look at that market opportunity - i should take over the invoicing dept by being more efficient han them"
