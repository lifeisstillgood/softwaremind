I went swimming with my iPhone in the Mediterrean. Help.
========================================================

Yes. I did it.

The look on the faces of the other's as I pulled my phone out of
my swimming trunks pocket was not nearly as shocked as the look on my own.

Turns out seawater is not great for smartphones.

I slowly start to put together my digital life


* passwords
* photos
* AWS access
* all the other TOTP accesses...oh god

Github is good - they *give* you the secret and you enter it in
AWS - no I cannot recreate it.
Aargh now what

I decide to start again, with good quality best practises
