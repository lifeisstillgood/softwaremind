privacy should be seen as harm related - what harm 


What humans do is organise
- since before the pyramids, humans have been able to work together in organised groups to produce more than the sun of our parts

And internet is clearly able to improve communication - almost every adult human *could* reach any other now.  

but additionally software enables processing of more data, to allow understanding of wider implications and modelling of future actions.

software allows prediction of collective actions

and politics will be more about deciding on course of action - and hopefully arguing about validity of models and priors rather than ideology 

Democracy is not just allowing each voter to choose, it is a process of educating each voter on possible courses and gaining understanding and commitment to that action - one thing we understand is that people in organisation who understand the mission and its needs will act more aligned
