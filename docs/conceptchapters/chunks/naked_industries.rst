Global companies exist
netflix cannot sustain its global streaming position with just N American revenues - it's too big.  Apple iphone is probably same way

But it could slim down - you do not have to have a single streamer - why not use torrents? locally cached shows even by your neighbours? well who pays? is there a mechanism to honour payment or to handle other DRM? 

so this is about all those other industries that just flow against natural common sense

It's partly SV bro culture
but also it's "this is what you get when you ask a software engineer to design "...

It's recognising the inherent unfairness of distribution of wealth and coming up with ... global communism ? 

and frankly throughout my book i am pushing a more fair, (monkeys, veils) society - and preferably one that works well for benefit of all

so nice to see i am in good company
