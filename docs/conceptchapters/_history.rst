History Of Software
===================

Software as we understadn it is a very young discipline, and even though I argue it is a form of literacy it is a very new form of literacy.

How much is software dependant on technology?
---------------------------------------------

I am still sticking with my "software as a form of literacy" concept.  But just as literacy was not possible without some form of mark-making technology (from clay and stick, to ink and pulp) literacy itself "transcends" the technology, but cannot exist without it - a virtual and real life split perhaps.

#Anyway the point is software is dependant on a compiler and a computer to actually fuction, yet on a daily basis my collegues and I review and read code that goes through no compiler other than each others brains.  But we need the experience of the code functioning in real life, to see the outputs running,
t hear as it were, the reeds clacking, so that we can model it in our heads and decide where to go next.

Different technologies drive different computing capabiities, which drives the software literacy tropes / genres we use to represent the new capabilities.

Yes we could all write assembler or even binary, and you know, people did. But we could all count by marking one line after another till we reached our age, but instead symbols encapsulate greater and greter higher level interpretations.

A story.
Databases waited for the technology to move from tapes to random access disks. Then we could get random access to any chunk of data enabling a new way of laying out data physically allowing for new ways to query and then SQL 
 

I think this is analsous to science fiction writing.
Shakespeare used fairies because aliens were not a well understood concept to his audience.  And rembmer tha software is both expressing ententions to a computer / compiler, it is also (equally? More so?) expressing intentions to the human reader (who needs to agree or understand and partner with the work)
