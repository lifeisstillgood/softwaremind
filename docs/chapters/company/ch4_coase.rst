:focus: how size and structure of companies is determined and it ain't management cleverness. 

Why are companies the size and structure they are. why are some companies more successful than others, seemingly able to take on more challenges at faster speed? 

these questions are the reason bookshops groan under the weight of hardback business books trying to sell the answers, but they also are deeply important questions for humans globally - the organisation, be it commercial company, government department or city hall is the umbrella of protection for almost all humans alive today - for legal protection, income and environment

COase and theory of firm

New firm

Programmable company:

* the entirity of business is in code. Not in the middle management,
  not in "how we do things"
  
  the approval workflow system is an example of how good but unavailable idea holds things back dramatically. scalability is not just size but speed as well
  
  designing your processes for scale matters too
  

We can see Apple Run book / operations managemet as the earlu step in this world
But a completely what-if, flexible company will be anle to turn on a dime.

But this will come at costs - humans dont do well and need ther sort of explanation and mission and feed into decision making

Imagine everyone having their own engaged model of the company (ciuntry) and arging which is best format.  May never decide? or may just go with flow?

Excellent take on coase minimum 

So in modern world the process is thenthings - a single slip up causes horro - something a s project mange I know too well.  Approvals ...

And so what is needed is solutions to this - continuous integration is tried - but this is fixing things after they gone wrong - just really quickly after they go wrong

Apples vaunted process is to model the process correctly first

And this is my argument for the new company - the programmable company is one where all the interactions are programmed and viable in pre-production allowing choice, optimisationand modelling
