That dense cities produce more social capital - if you can walk or cycle to a park a shop a protest a school your life has better capital.  if 1/3 of space is devoted to car driving and parking we could move people onwards 


we also stringtowns and the idea of a critical mass of tax base

- that we live in an obseogeneoc environment 

- that we can be happier with training - MOOP

- that we can be wealthier with artificial agents on our side (open source investment boys)

- that marriage is 

- that ten billion should not be enough

- that wat is not inevitable 

- that government should go open 

- that sensible fiscal policy is possible ina democracy - 

- education and unbundling

- pensions and valuable work 

- children and radioing then better with continuous monitoring 

- artificial light has made waaay more difference than we accept and we should all get more sleep

- retirement will soon become a goal of ones own tenure 

- the problem with UBI is not how to pay for it (cf Modern management theory) but how to find things that we want done - most capital will be social - after all efficient energy use is still "use for human benefit" 

As soch the most productive societies will be those sitting around taking care of their young and old, with occasional space flights

All other work would be well paid full time hobbies (tenure)
