==================================
Do we need Managers or Financiers?
==================================

"You did not just cross the line, you are so far past the line, the line is a
*dot*"

- Joey, Friends

Abstraction helps.  We cannot carry around all the details all the time.
But The Economist curse is real.

As a rule of thumb I think 2 orders of magnitude is when you stop being able to
manage directly and need to rely on financing as a tool.

100 servers? 100 developers, maybe 1000 servers?
But you need warning lights on the dashboard, actual actions when reaching
thresholds, an ability to introspect, and real owners / gatekeepers.

But also how many layers of abstraction. CEO example, Cabinet Minister wexamples

2 orders of magnitude, 3 layers of abstraction

Proof Of Concept (No or Lo-code solutions. Excel.)
Rules Driven (configuration, libraries orchestrated)
Language driven (compilers, DSLs)
- which outputs machine code?

  concept of recursion is important???

No

Directed coding (proof concept, lo-code solution)
Indirect Coding (rules, config, reuse)
Tooling to understand Indirect coding



Scale is a Blessing and A problem
---------------------------------

Humans seemed to evolve to live in smallish tribes - dunbar number of 150.
But economics seems to be a feature of human interaction. 
and that scales. iPencil Like

We live like fish in water that is hard to see - since 1500s it has taken power of state to make and field armies and arms, and by WW1 this was impossible.

But WW2 saw 2 innovations.  One airplanes, oil, tanks movement.
The other Bletchly park - gatehr all the data and sift through it.

Organisations and Scale
=======================

Humans have a challenge. Human brains are more or less optimised for handling a small tribe of people - a dozen or two, maybe up to the Dunbar Number of 150.  More than that and we forget or get confused or cannot work out who is family.  This is why celbritoes and politicians want to be your father or mother figure. so you remeber who the f**k they are.

The problem is there are 8 billion people.

Organising at scale is a problem.  We have tried to successively solve it. Religion, agricultire, education, kings, empires, military. Nation states. Science.

Science worked. mostly.

But its not merely building a single organisation that does a single thing.  Militaries have managed that.  Its building a single orgnaisaiton that can then change.  Pivot. 

We really suck at that. Name a government department. You know one. The UK Post Office is a pertinatn exmaple right now.  How do you come in with a new broom on that one.


Organisaing software in the small
----------------------------------

Film making as a metaphor.

Tech lead - I dont maange people I manage code (Linus Torvalds)
(?)       - Producer. Solving problems you did not know existed.
(?)       - Manager - building systems that solve problem before the producer encoutners them



also
also - film making as a metaphor

single director single work 
but still director has many people but can be there 

but CGI is lotsnif film scenes done bu different artists so making coherent whole kichbharder - use if pre viz etc 


2 Orders of magnitude
---------------------

A way of thinking of responsibility outlines 

How do we organise.
Getting data structures right in software matters.
Getting human structures also matters.
When does my detail becaome your abstraction

Abstraction cut off layers.
