What is Software Literacy.
We are reshaping the world by making it explict, introspectable, open.
There are enormous implications.  Similarly in history we have chosen to become urban dwellers, agricutrlists,and now knowledge workers and organisers at scale

organising at scale
Teaching people how to become human, education - has had enormous benefits.

We have been reacting against being told  what to do - Trump to Brexit.
But we do need to identify the problem, identify a solution, do the solution. Nudges wont work.
Its too short a time scale to do it thorugh education

But openly modelling, providing literate solutions so people can read what and why they are guided.

This will help.
But not everyone

But toll is mental health issues that manifest in a urban buttoned down world.
But we have been given less freedom
