Democracy in companies
----------------------
Shareholder voting should be legally binding on election of directors.  And it should be possible to have contested elections (ie different parties) on the ballot.

privacy should be seen as harm related - what harm 


What humans do is organise
- since before the pyramids, humans have been able to work together in organised groups to produce more than the sun of our parts

And internet is clearly able to improve communication - almost every adult human *could* reach any other now.  

but additionally software enables processing of more data, to allow understanding of wider implications and modelling of future actions.

software allows prediction of collective actions

and politics will be more about deciding on course of action - and hopefully arguing about validity of models and priors rather than ideology 

Democracy is not just allowing each voter to choose, it is a process of educating each voter on possible courses and gaining understanding and commitment to that action - one thing we understand is that people in organisation who understand the mission and its needs will act more aligned 

(it's the why dictators armies are bad, argument redux) 

Are dictators armies worse?

Strategy in a geography-less world 

https://youtu.be/nEe8JX0YKBE
Mahan and naval strategy 

point being is that geography plays enormous part of strategy into operations - what effect does geography have

and swardley is first glimmer of attempt to map out implications and allow strategic choices

It also asks what is a state? When looking at which state has sea control and so will gain the wealth and trade benefits, what is the diff between UK and US? NATO and nations? Do we think that the recent minimum corporate tax is a global strategic gain - that countries in that are essentially joining in a trade union - and will be able to share wealth and have little need to compete ? 

it's a nice theory (US special presence changes a lot of that but still).  

china going to war may chnage this - traditional vs non traditional - traditional is nuclear umbrella forces them to build nuclear triad (icbms submarines air force) and enter same position re russia

but a trade based approach might mean sharing pacific trade - the volume is between both of them.  china belt and roads is desire to not be dependant on amaeica

one thing to note is china making better strategic choices because the leo l of policy discussion in democracy is ... woeful

Swardley - we have no idea what a real map of multi dmlimensional geography and technology will even look like - it's probably a game like engine
