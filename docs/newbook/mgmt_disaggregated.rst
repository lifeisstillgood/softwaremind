============================
Disaggregtion of maangement
============================

The through road is: managment is being disrupted. (see MOOP). The supervisory
aspect is a relic of industrial revoilution, knowledge working is small science
like contorbutions, coders as new managers, finance as guardrails, resource
allocation is leave people alone, deep state can be controlled, but Post office
shows how an organisation can become toxic. And we have only two solutions
openness, and good people at all levels contributing.  And Toxicity of the
prospect of wealth fights that hence wealth tax and equality.  Democratic bet is
equal say, equal shares, and positive missions beats feudal torunamentts working
to enrich the wealthy.  Its not much of a bet. But i want to make it.

Will we see companies as deserving of sduch toxic defence if they are more machines
than people?

Partly its mission orientated, partly its spotting what is wrong, and partly
itsfighting entropy. Beware of entropy winning you might be missing core idea.
Richard Osman tells a story about as a producer of a game show "The Wheel",
which involved a floor sized wheel that turns to allow different celebrities to 
answer questions, the composer and the engineer got together to create the  interlude music, so that the music would rise and fall at the speed of the spinning floor starting and stopping.  He describes that as "I f that was me I
would not realise it was a problem, but two people are across town making my show better, simply by being excellent at thier jobs".
But why are those people excellent at their jobs? There is not a mission that
says "music to match visuals" is there? The producer (manager) did not set it
out in the requirements. They were not directed.  They spotted what was wrong
and took appropriate action to remove. However if they had been micro-managed on
a time scale not allowing that then it would not happen and the end result would
be poorer.  So finance (reousrce alloaction) allowed it to be better. The issue
is when to spend the money and when not? That is "knowing what is wrong".
Perhaps watching the pilot it is painful to have th music at worng pace and
everyone sees it? I dont know but there is a test - a failing test in swe
terms.We could set some simple (even autoamted) tests - "is there any interlude
music when wheel spins? No fine ggrab a library file.". Does the music cause
1/10 test viewers to wince? Yes. FIne ask ChatGPT to compose something. Does the
wince test still occur? FIne get real composers in for real money.
Or perhaps leap to the end one. But either way we are working a finance
question - a budget.  But then, what is the difference between financeir and
manager? I say 2 orders of magnitude is what huiman brain can cope with. Maybe
three.  Then you rely on rules of thumb and abstrations.  But...automated
software tests cut through that. ou can see all the tests.  So our programmabmle
company our cmpany of future can be managed beyond the 2 orders magnitue. and
that has impications for managing at scale and managing deep state, and the
theory of the firm. then what is the antognist for the theory of the firm - if
software testing, sop and modelling can allow deep control - what is the hope
for our side of the Totalitarian bet?  Openness, smart regulation, society
first, but mostly openness, and journalism and a fair playing field (smaller
firms allocating sensibly).  We need a wealth tax to levelplaying field, we need
regulatiojns to open com-pany fianances (anti-commercial confidentiality laws)
and data ownership laws (not privacy).  Its really tough.  
Democracy relies on decent people at all levels doing decent job - post office
and nazism and so on - the system is there but democracy needs
not whistleblowers but dailynwhistleblowers - iron law of bureaucracy 


real agile - fire managers
--------------------------
https://www.greptile.com/blog/100-devs

the real agile manifesto focused on code 
and working code

how fo we know what is working (testing - in real life and in tests)

comprehensive whole org test rigs enable 
orgs to change faster and move faster - the whole point of agile
there will be a lot to it but smaller
is good
being honest about why size matters (shared treasury hence lower internal intersst rates)



================================
Built Organisations, Deep State
================================

legacy costs of PRocess as well a physical legacy

* legacy cost in software. Reduce the impact of legacy cost will be a major factor in
meeting changes. "Move fast and break things is needed for legacy removal"

brett devereau - legacy cost of factories - the same factory (in the same location)

wouldnnot be usabke by henry ford and robert stevenson

but abikity to wipe out and rebuild infrastructure (on a daily basis- immutabke servers)
is enormous - hence nix. if you want to transfer to new infrastructure it is theoretically
a config file.

of course it is not - but we need to be at the whole org test rig poit there

why hapan and germany could rebuild cos revuilt fro scratch


Legacy is an indistrial problem or rather a paradigm problem if you were the legacy owner
in 1100 of all the land of France it was not a problem, it was kind of yhe point. if in
1938 younwere the lefacy owner of 6000 Renault ft18 tanks that were "the best tanks in the
last war" then yeahbit was aproblem they were designed before henry ford, they were built
in factories built 20 years ago - but "what are wesupposed to do - throw then all awayband
start again?" the dreadnaught problem Google for example is expeirencing a legacy problem
As it wwiped out yahoo.


==================================
Do we need Managers or Financiers?
==================================

"You did not just cross the line, you are so far past the line, the line is a
*dot*"

- Joey, Friends

Abstraction helps manage the size problem.
Markets are one abstractiin management orovlem
simulation shoukd be another
But The Economist curse is real.

As a rule of thumb I think 2 orders of magnitude is when you stop being able to
manage directly and need to rely on financing as a tool.

100 servers? 100 developers, maybe 1000 servers?
But you need warning lights on the dashboard, actual actions when reaching
thresholds, an ability to introspect, and real owners / gatekeepers.

But also how many layers of abstraction. CEO example, Cabinet Minister wexamples

2 orders of magnitude, 3 layers of abstraction

Proof Of Concept (No or Lo-code solutions. Excel.)
Rules Driven (configuration, libraries orchestrated)
Language driven (compilers, DSLs)
- which outputs machine code?

  concept of recursion is important???

No

Directed coding (proof concept, lo-code solution)
Indirect Coding (rules, config, reuse)
Tooling to understand Indirect coding



Scale is a Blessing and A problem
---------------------------------

Humans seemed to evolve to live in smallish tribes - dunbar number of 150.
But economics seems to be a feature of human interaction. 
and that scales. iPencil Like

We live like fish in water that is hard to see - 
since 1500s it has taken power of state to make and field armies 
and arms, but by WWI the power and scale of industrialisation
had created armies that were immense (millions of men under arms on 
both sides), with destructive power of industrialisation (high explosive).
But co-ordination failed. the western fromt stalemente (see ACOUP) 
was mostly a structural problem - they coukd not fire shells far enough 
but also a communication probme - panzer divisions worked be ause radios 
kept them in contact with each other and air cover.



But WW2 saw 2 innovations.  One airplanes, oil, tanks movement.
The other Bletchly park - gatehr all the data and sift through it.

Organisations and Scale
=======================

Humans have a challenge. Human brains are more or less optimised for handling a small tribe of people - a dozen or two, maybe up to the Dunbar Number of 150.  More than that and we forget or get confused or cannot work out who is family.  This is why celbritoes and politicians want to be your father or mother figure. so you remeber who the f**k they are.

The problem is there are 8 billion people.

Organising at scale is a problem.  We have tried to successively solve it. Religion, agricultire, education, kings, empires, military. Nation states. Science.

Science worked. mostly.

But its not merely building a single organisation that does a single thing.  Militaries have managed that.  Its building a single orgnaisaiton that can then change.  Pivot. 

We really suck at that. Name a government department. You know one. The UK Post Office is a pertinatn exmaple right now.  How do you come in with a new broom on that one.


Organisaing software in the small
----------------------------------

Film making as a metaphor.

Tech lead - I dont maange people I manage code (Linus Torvalds)
(?)       - Producer. Solving problems you did not know existed.
(?)       - Manager - building systems that solve problem before the producer encoutners them



also
also - film making as a metaphor

single director single work 
but still director has many people but can be there 

but CGI is lotsnif film scenes done bu different artists so making coherent whole kichbharder - use if pre viz etc 


2 Orders of magnitude
---------------------

A way of thinking of responsibility outlines 

How do we organise.
Getting data structures right in software matters.
Getting human structures also matters.
When does my detail becaome your abstraction

Abstraction cut off layers.

id, ego, Superego

Zipper Project Planning
=======================

My bugbear. Driving to new york, shouting 'progress reports' back to shore. But similarly
people thnking they are such masters of the world they can plan the arrival of new work
like a zipper.
