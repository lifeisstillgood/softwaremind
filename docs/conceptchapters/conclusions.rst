The human marriage with technology is only going to deepen - so as individuals we need to set the terms - FOSS is only part of the solution

Sweep of history 
----------------
https://youtu.be/iTWOXRCyOY4

big issues are population growth (4 waves - might middle ages, cromwell, industrial revolution and 20th c borlaug revolution)

each alcott had massive impacts and issues - inflation, 

also cultural changes - mono culture not feasible with massive growth - so get acceptance of alternative lifestyles (bisexuality etc), racism and political polarisation as we hunt for security of our tribe in a changing world
(inflation tends to help well calitalised who can invest against the destruction of value measure in their currency)

NB this has good historical flow of political polarisation  - which implies the facebook is not a causal factor - this has all happened before 


BUT

literacy made a difference then and i am betting on two things - software literacy making  difference now and doubling down on democracy will help valve the pressure cooker 

BUT

after each crisis there is a new paradigm for administering world - reneissance etc
is software at the heart of the next one? can we get there without bloodshed? 

Why WWI?

there was no realisation that the real growth was no longer over land - decoupling wealth from land decouples war ?

    We see the benefits of computers everywhere, at home, at work,
    except in the productivity statistics.
    -- Robert Solow
    (https://eml.berkeley.edu/~bhhall/e124/David90_dynamo.pdf)    

I have a simple argument - he is correct, not because software and
computers cannot improve business and public productivity, but because
computers are not being used *effectively*.  It would be like
complaining that we see notepads and pencils everywhere, except in the
productivity statistics, but only to discover that most people cannot
read and write and are just carrying the notepads around because they
dont want to be left out.

::

	Software Reliability Engineering (SRE) is what happens when
	you ask a developer to design an operations team.

Google is justifiably proud of its' SRE teams - developing their own
software to run the computers, data centres, networks and release
processes that their success stood on was the only way to work at
"web-scale".  Companies like Google and Amazon run more and more of
their business purely thorugh software - data centres, networks and
prices are determined by software.  Having humans in the way would
have seriously slowed them down.  ANd in doing more and more of their
business purely through sdoftware they had to organise their business
differently.

::

	but at Amazon's vast scale ["best practises" of the time] was
	about as useful as telling Indiana Jones to look both ways
	before crossing the street.
	- Steve Yegge
	https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611


Now, the concept of "DevOps" and "SRE" are now embedded in
the minds of modern managers, few will admit they fall short.
SOmetimes they fall very short indeed - the UK's Post Office Horizon scandal


So, if SRE is what we get when developers design an operations team::

   A Programmable Company is what you get when you ask a developer to
   design a company.

   But what do we get when we ask developers to design a whole society?


If you understand grammar, sentence structure, paragraphs, chapters,
character development and three-act story structure, you can write
a OK-ish novel about pretty much anything.

If you cannot read or write, have never heard of a character arc, and
your bonus depends on it, then the novel you write is likely to make
as much sense as the Kafka-esque companies most of us work in.

Its simple.  But very hard to change.

Corruption index and good corporate citizenship
------------------

Prof Yuen Yuen Ang suggests there are three (four) levels of corruption in developing / developed worlds

- Shake down : give me protection money or Inhurt you 
- Veto: pay me or i stop your project
- Speed up: pay me and I approve the licenses that otherwise take 4 months
- Access : pay me and you get to talk with the president and gain monopoly access 

China in 98 took action to reduce the first two through focus on *administrative* reforms - how many civil servants are there how much are they paid, and by 2012 raised the pay of civil servants to decent enough level that corruption was not a survival choice

But countries lik brazil india have not made those boring administrative reforms ans suffered for it

so what are my corporate citizen levels 

- ignoring / refusing new action
- information hoarding 
- helpfulness hoarding
- 

systems like common ticketing and time tracking help

common published data 

Personal Software agents 
-------------------------

I fervently believe that having software "agents" that work to overcome the algorithmic feed and provide us with balanced / beneficial social media.  It's going to be a long slog to get there, kind of like our generations fight for safety at work legislation (or pollution legislation).

This needs not only the software to exist (what plug-in do you use?) but the regulatory environment to allow / support / promote it and controversially the default settings - which I suspect will be the biggest political fight - I think we need to explore the concepts of Libertarian Paternalism exposed by Richard Thaler.


Future of search
----------------

We went from lists (yahoo) to search (jeeves) to good search (google) 

Amazon now has 15bn dollar search business - product search.  Becaus you cannot find anything you want on amazon with nljoowing what you already want - so the discovery portion is being done by people like four hour work week drop shippers 

So where is value ? Where is appropriate to me?

it comes in form of curation - which is basically looking for someone who has simla or or leading tastes to you

cannot have a 1000 true fans but you could have a thousand 


privacy
-------
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24627363&p=2
social cooling 
but no

privacy is other people
politely ignoring what they can observe about you - it's just now possible to observe from grater distance en mass - it's not secrecy

the problem lies not in the collection but in the action on the collected data - it's not polite to gossip about the loud argument the neighbours had or the long visits the milkman takes, but it's not illegal either.  And it is not polite to serve me adverts about the TV i just looked up - but it's not illegal. But is it (should it) be illegal to serve ads for lower paid jobs to people likely to be women, or ads to gambling addicts or refuse a job based on a ten year old photo? 

Privacy is not the problem - politeness and legality are. 


We should be wary of peoples stated reasons - a group of young women saying they feel their photos could be used against then in a job search in ten years time might be true, but tends to fly in the face of human experience of youth and wild days.  However it is a very good excuse to give to the drunk asshat who is pressuring you to join a wet T-shirt competition.  cf trend for handing out red cards and yellow cards 


Covid is speeding up remote working no!!

Reputation and privacy
----------------------

Reputation is fine (can be games or fraudulent but generally works).  But it needs a reputation decay rate 

Also reputation radius - and weighting - is not enjoying a uber ride relevant to one shonesty in diamond trading? 

The rough and tumble real world
-------------------------

I think this encompasses rule of law, 

In many geographical areas of the world there is not effective rule of law - so the rule of killing the worst people to hopefully bring back rule of law applies.  There are also areas of the non-geographical world - crime, and large parts of the internet.

Additionally publish the plan vs discretion and boundaries

oversight and illegality 


How the secret service needs to make at least one person in the room lose bladder control 

Your own facts
--------------

At certain scale need to have continuing professional education - how everyone knows everyone else is up to date

a political solution too - it was one of the biggest solutions mass centralised media played and is one of the major failings of mass decentralised media - no one agrees on the same set of (important) facts. (ignoring fake news - look at labour online and labour massmedia where 2016 it was fox hunts and whaling online)  

So how do we agree on same set of facts - it's almost like manifestos - there should be continuous problem definitions - government saying this is the problem and we are solving it (it's like a campaign "build a wall") 

how can this be responsibly managed?? 


Social media and social change
-----------------------
https://www.cracked.com/article_19225_5-reasons-twitter-isnt-actually-overthrowing-governments.html

Problem with social media
-------------------------

It's joy fake news or misinformation - it is expectation.

We expected articles on facebook to have the same weight as Washington post.  But they cannot the economics just don't work

so we should treat social media as it is - a recording of ebru conversation in every pub everywhere 

Yes we might be able to eavesdrop on the bon mots at the Algonquin round table, or perhaps over hear Einstein chatting to Dorak, but we basically won't - and we should treat it the same.

Our expectations of curation need to change - unless we have curation we won't get it. 

pay for curation ... 

That will also help to solve the "same set of facts"
problem  - 


Review sites and freedom
------------------------

Review site suffer a problem of astroturfing / trying to persuade people to buy something / anything.

so people try to turn to sites like reddit - to get the pub conversation that would be the equivalent of "oh bobbbought one of those washing machines and it broke twice in the first year".  

This is fine IRL because no one buys a house in your neighbourhood and heads to the pub in order to influence your choice of washing machine.  But they happily will create sock puppet account on reddit

The solution is really only going to be client certificates signed by the government - a sort of online passport.

This will be ok for most people in democracies - we already are 

it will of course make freedom worse in oppressive dictatorships but things are pretty shit there anyhow and we were fools to dream that TCP/IP would replace the hard work of ensuring human freedom - we have to earn freedom the hard way, in real life. 


Then the sensible technical solutions will be available

Isn't everthing "done" now?
===========================

No. Not at all.::

    Most people are online
    Most of the Money is not
    (Ben Evans)

Most if commerce, most of government, in Western world, let alone
globally, are not "digital".  They are not "programmable", or even
visible on the virtual world.  Vast amounts of activity is invisible
online, let alone enabling meaningful interaction with that activity.

THat is the challenge of programmable companies - making the virtual
still reach the world.


Double down on what works
--------------------------

Western liberal 

* Productivity Gains unrealised
* Benefits not embraced
* SME is what you get when you ask a develooer to design a Operations department

* Programmable company is what you get when you ask a developer to design
an entire company

* What do we get when we ask developers to design a whole society

- transparency, democracy, openness, empiricism, competition these are the things to double down on - they have worked in fits and starts for 150 years, and past 75. 

The economist Robert Solow once quipped that   It has been argued
 that this
is because we are missing the essential rearrangement

Two productivity arguments - we aren't inventing stuff or we don't
have demand side drivers in western world - that is we can outsource
to cheap labour (Foxconn and Apple make iPhones) If we see 70s then
people invested massively as labour price was skyrocketing - similar
to post world war 1 (immigration, death etc)

Only when we absorb all human capacity to modern levels or social
changes

I think this is right - but it needs a little deeper
explanation. Let's look at architects, project managers and
bricklayers

Also internet not changed as much as washing machine - we see the big
communications changes in telegraph. Internet is changing the consumer
(the out of work ways we spend our time)

But it is still hard to see it transforming the in work hours.  Web
technologies do appear everywhere - but this is a function of more
robots ready to build houses - if only the instruction were there.



We only need project managers because the architects were not precise
enough. So the replacement of the bricklayer will soon become the
replacemt of project manager - the great hollowing out.

But this cannot happen if a business is still the equivalent of a
blueprint - needing builders and somon to actually make it work.

Only a programmable company, can be designed like an architect designs
a building - and only at that point can we look at theory of firm. At
things trading on our behalf, at companies that can be formed - is
this insane? Maybe but that's never meant wrong.


I did have the whole internet printing press thing going.  But we need
to look deeper

Software is not seeing the productivity gains it should.  But why?

Firstly we are not software literate as companies Not seeing right
size nor right interfaces

Second we are of seeing marketplace of companies to enable right
sizing But we can define what it is - code as the definition of all


Productivity gains held back by company structure, lack of code at all
levels

Architecture paradox - what we see as companies are not all the
decisions and functions needed - we are not seeing
everything. Software literate company will raise to level of explicit
code eachnof those activities - it will be real architecture to build.

A programmable company is one where all its activities and decisions
are encoded. See Apple and its runbook.  When asking for a quote ""


What is a programmable company - where it's decision processes are
both encoded, and adjustable by internal (direct coding) and external
(customers choosing or not choosing to buy, take action)

As much of facebooks actions, it's resource allocation, are steered by
the mass actions of its user base. It is a vast AB test. Now inntheory
this is true of any company - if we stop buying diesel cars GM will
stop making them. But the feedback is so crude and so long term that
it has little effect.  But the programmable company has much finer
grained touch points and is more attuned to them. More ML means even
more attundedness


So programmable company has all of its activities and its decision
points in code (migration to infrastructure as code) and these nodes
are programmable by internal and external actions.  This assumes more
democracy in the internal decisions (explicitly excluding people is
harder. See the linux hierarchy ? Open discussion, Chinese parliament)

With more activity automated we will see both more effi envy and more
problems - serverless world is where companies have to rebuild their
factories to accommodate software, the grain of the internet

Amazon had to solve these internally and basically released it.

Putting everything into code is the only way forward - from routing to
deliveries to accounts the whole skeleton of companies will need to be
as defined by code as an AWS web server.

We are going to redesign that much


Architecture paradox But this leads to the architecture paradox - by
having a robot do the building there is a lot more upfront work
fromthe architect (coding)

Productivity conjecture
- we are missing the re-arrangement of work - that software literacy may be 

I reject utterly that now that every freaking adult on the planet can
communicate with every other that we are not seeing productivity gains
(mobile phone choosing best market for produce)

- biggest idea is the iPhone. We just are not seeing the productivity
  gains we expect forom the Internet. It is hard to credit that it is
  a bubble the whole world has bought. We are nearly at a stage where
  every adult human has online access of some form.  That matters
  deeply

What we are missing is the re-organisation of the factory similar to that of electrification

We are missing the dynamo. 





A point about Pikety
--------------------

* Pikety redux

  - Labour lost, capital won (the reaosn wages not  subject to suply demand)
  - the great hollowing out
  - literacy and automation
  - Snowden was also right - data and pollution 
  - snowden
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog
http://www.nsaplayset.org
- Whats happening in the world - a sense of perspective
* http://www.digitalattackmap.com/faq/
* also want, wars, trade, shipping, energy, employment, poverty, investment etc.* 
some kind of model / mapp for the whole world. where is the money flowing / going?


  That the record of software coming in to disrupt industry is good -
  it's hard to learn software.  As a company this book is about having
  software in your company DNA

A point about project management and democratic companies
---------------------------------------------------------

I am going to stick my neck out and go for it - companies will become
more democratic - we shall see more voting and consensus in the
workplace.  We will also see the end of deadlines as companies become
*event driven* - that is, instead of shouting "get to this point"
there will be more "we need to get here" and monitoring and
encouragement.


The problem is *always* at the top
----------------------------------

Most technical problems can be solved by changing the business environment.
If the security of a company is challenged because a top level executive refuses to follow
the security restrictions, then there is a clear choice betwene firing the Sales Director
or having security.  Only the Board can decide that, and once they do it must be clear.

Google is currently experiencing a similar issue over sexual harrassment.

Data publication




Fractal Management
------------------

How individuals and teams need to model, monitor, mentor.


- CI and repeatability
- reporting on functionality of running processes
- analysis of inputs, running, outputs
- reporting upwards and outwards
- marketing your code





security (secrets management & auth)
------------------------------------
-- user management / aithentication authorisation
-- FIDO


security (deployment / repeatability)
-------------------------------------


prod parallel
-------------
Modelling



-- plumbing







   


A point about Simplicity
========================


Our golden goal is to keep things simple.

Simple breaks in simple ways, simple is simple to extend and improve.

Its not that simple is *easy* - often it is the opposite of easy, or quick.

But simple wins out over time. Simple gives great ROI.

I throughly recommend listening to Rich Hickey on this subject (Link)

So please keep in mind - we aim for simple.  Even if our day to day
work pushes us to quick and easy and complicated.  We need to push
back.


Data Mangement  Philosophy
==========================

Data Publishing needs to be a business level function, providing
consistent accurate and timely data to the rest of the organisation is
a vital task.

Like Bezos, can only consume data that is published - and people only
publishbsokething they willing to support

"but i cannot get my job done if "... that's not the problem ... the
problem is clean data

it's like security - it's a priority or it is not.








.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] The linked essay is by Eric S Raymond and is almost two
   decades old, and lays out an important philosophical difference
   between how open source software gets developed (in a mad press of new
   things being tried out) and how cathedrals are built.  The cathedral
   builders have tried to learn from the bazaar, and concepts like Agile
   are helping (a bit) but building software in our modern day
   institutions is still frustrating.  As software eats the world, it
   will find politics and push back.


Leassons from Amazon
--------------------

Using SteveY's rant

we see
1. API SOA is the right way

2. lots to learn from amazon

3. that testing is an interesting apprpach - QA and unit tests lie on a
spectrum, and that have solid production monitoirng is effectively having solid testing.  I go for doctests and QA tests as the right balance - too much mocking is too much mucking about.  You seem to get concetpually the right level of breakdown. not the level for your testing tool.  Having more test code than actual code is *not* a positive.

4. also interesting view on coase - not merely size of pizza team, but
reuse of code as a metric of organisational cohesion - start up to spreadeagled.
Lots of companies have many ways to do same thing.  But there should be one right way to do it. Look at xkcd cartoon - 14 different standards.  A cohesive org has one common standard - by fiat or by discussion.  If an org is happy to allow many flowers to bloom to find the right way then frankly its a community not an atomic unit.



Kaizen vs Kaikaku
-----------------

Run the company vs change the company

Incremental change (AB testing) vs Radical change

WHy not SaaS
------------

BEcause I *should* be able to do:

::

   authenticate('mycompany')
   for employee in get_all_my_employees():
       if employee.isTimesheetComplete:
           approve_payroll(employee)
	   send_payment_to_bank(employee)
	   send_email_to_employee(employee, template="youarepaid")

Now, there is a lot of noise about IFTT and all the SaaS providers and
so on but - they are wrong.

The above is the *right* way.

It just is.  You know it is.


Operations
----------
Severity Levels
usually maps to customer impact

(Apologies to Abraham Lincoln)

* All of the people cannot use all of it, all of the time
* All of the people cannot use some of it, all of the time
* Some of the people cannot use all of it
* Some of the people cannot use some of it
* Some of our capacity or redundnacy is lost, but no people are affected
* Everything Else

Is like a DefCon - actual *action* is required and defined and taken
(ie customer support portal is updated, these people are notified.)

This is *still* a programmable company - only we did not programm it
to deal with this situation and so it needs to be worked *on* not *in*


Politics and software
----------------------

- new economics becoming clearer - the neo-liberal consensus seems agonisingly wrong in Africa and just misguided post 2008
Open source - oss4gov manifesto



I argue that we are seeing three trends coming together

- coaseian ideal firm size is shrinking. Look at Bank of America/google.  Challenger banks etc. Yes vast scale matters - but at a certain point all business transactions are entries in a shared ledger. Remind you of something.


I don't think we are there yet. Ledger technologies don't scale to the level we care about punlically. But internally we are there.  But so was email before internet - the big win for electrification was the dynamo. 

- faster feedback on customer likes - wants in tech firms. Killing lions, cutting through beiraicy (end of project managers) 
- most projects are co-ordination - but code is self co-ordinating - programmable company is a non-project company

A programmable company is one where the current decisions are encoded in software

So let's imagine we take a decision on a project - this must mean a chnage to something (else it's a rubbish decision) so we record 

- what was decided
- why it was decided
- how to judge its success

This is a series of commits / changes across the base - from change to monitoring system to commits on the codebase 


Summary

If you are not coding, start
If you are not replacing whole projects with code that checks if other code is doing what it's supposed to, do that
If you are not migrating to a serverless, run anywhere model (with server-led for some highly optimised areas) do that
If you are not using crypto-signed ledgers everywheee internally do that
If your companies actions, reactions and decisions are not in code, do that
If you cannot do what if analysis on your company's defining code, do that

Culture 
Ok it's not the dog whistle version here - genuinely

Discuss economic changes (ha join Chang) - the reworking of world economic theory from neon liberalism after 2008. It is highly likely to undergo changes in western world

Now the software that is written is ireducably connected to culture it came from- the liberal hippy anti government culture of Berkeley has had enourmous impact (beards and gpls)
What is impact of Indian and Chinese culture - hard to say from outside. Some ideas are possible - less regexs, 

But open gov is almost a democractod imperative
I push Oss4gov but I need it funded by right wing maniacs

Facebook and radio lab podcast
expand a lot
Centralising has lead to trying to moderate at billion people scale - this leads to facebook moderation currently at 16,000 people looking at a million flagged items a day

Facebook is not the problem - just a symptom 
-------------------------

The issue here is fundamental to the Internet - it's not Facebooks "fault" - although they turned it up to 11.  The issue is that facebook in particular and the internet in general allows one person (or a small tribe ofnlike minded people) to publish and disseminate their point of view their philosophy their truth to millions or billions.  This in some cases is wonderful- arab spring perhaps

but looking at democracy i elections the main rprblemnwith fake news is not Russian interfeeemce - but that american citizens can spread their own fake news - trying to end the world to their biases.  it sounds like democracy and freedom - but is the freedom to shit all o we everything really a benefit to society? 

when do we shut down freedom? When someone yells fire in a crowded theatre? and if we can shutdown freedom for the good of society - just how different is that sentence from every dictator ?

The answer is IMO the court system and the law.  

I think we may need laws on debate - on facts and opinions in law? 

Look at the actions of law firm in shutting down rumours of gay mcAlpine 

The next issue is that facebook should not be making policy on what is or is not truth or acceptable in an election.  Fundamentally that's a lot of power for an
unelected 36 year old to have - and facebook asks to be regulated so that it places the problem back where it belongs - with politics.

this is feasible for one jurisdiction like the us - and more complex for jurisdictions like western democracies but it's being sorted - basically be omg a balkanised facebook ( which implies that local based social media like next door.con will be good trades).  does this mean we won't see d so tact spread through social media? no.  it will be a publicationnplatform - like that of mexican gang war photos. it will have the truth in it.  but it will be controlled by local jurisdictions and culture.

it will be a lot easier to keep that local - even if we lose a lot.

but can we see international jurisdictions changing? europe is the great hope here - 

the trade off between better (western cultural) norms (!) and raising the floor and being able to deal with granularity 

It most reminds me of the rowntrees model village - where they tried to make perfect community
Which is nice but it did not work for everyone and it chafed a lot and eventually people moved out because they wanted different freedoms - 

walled garden is nice but if you cannot build on the garden and create your own house and community then ... you will eventually outgrow it

Christian anarchist - eschew violence and eschew the state.

But real world does not? 

paradox? 


Discovery, advertising, profits and agents
-------------------

So, we are seeing the unbundling of advertising and discovery (review sites perhaps are a form of discovery as is other people recommendations)  Advertising used to be both

Pretty much all tech firms are advertising based - google and facebook obv but amazon has almost as much profit from ads on its own site as aws (https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/9/6/amazons-profits)

But, libertarian pateism suggests we don't need that much stuff, and i suggest we will be guided by agents regulated to have our interests up front - so advertising to us won't be acceptable. 

So agents will become a form of discovery - with some form of regulated product review process and standards orgs.

Solving the review process??? 



Stop blaming technology for decisions by corporations and governments

Facebook strategic reasons for sharing data 

https://www.theregister.com/2018/12/20/facebook_disaster/


Facebook regulation
-------------------

Social media is just a way of surfacing and punting all the loud drunks in bars across the land - it's not causing boorish arseholes it's just counting then (and some degree of encouraging by helping them find each other)

solutions: 
regulation 

but do we use social media as a forcing function to get international co operation ??? seems dubious at best - strategy is to beshinomgnbeacon of democracy freedom and wealth 

algorithm changes - drop boron rods into the algorithm - 

force citation 

Wikipedia as a surprisingly good example 
- how to regulate like wikipedia? 

ultimately it has to have good faith intentions.  and cost to punish bad faith lower than not

Problems with PageRank
----------------------

Facebook and youtube etc are aggregators - and a problem with Pagerank leads to a global feedback loop - that google (the essential search engine) assumes that a *domain* that has high quality in one location has high quality across the board.

So facebook.com/newyorktimes is seen as good content by google.  And then facebook.com/grotmoron gets that same level of google juice.

This means that if you want your web page to be found by google it is waaaay better to put it on facebook than on your own domain

this leads to positive feedback loop for aggregators and a negative one for the domain based internet (which is how it is designed)

but this is a flawed google (search engine) view - in other words facebook is assumed to be guaranteeing quality of all its content - which effectively makes it a publisher (the big radiolab discussion on moderation at scale)

so some form of regulation for search engine seems sensible - ie something in robots.txt that tells you the site structure and site governance (ie this bit we publish, this bit is platform

- this hierarchy failed in europe as we lived in state of total war
- like japanese
- but that meant our society has to be more equal - hierarchies were less steep
- so when 

comparing christianity to aztec - no cannibalism, able to survive plagues (ps aztecs had no cattle so basically cannibals)

but cannibalism and sacrifice meant destruction of means of production 

we only took off after stopped slaughtering cattle in winter else they would starve (turnips )

But basically a socialist society where we share most is most stable in times of shock - as we approachbsungularity guess what we will have

and how have we handled covid - sharing community sacrifice for common good.

the direction is clear


VC funding is just ensuring nice middle class life not threatens when trying to build company

But point of (most) companies is not wealth creation (!) - Facebook just took ad revenue from Fifth Avenue
Amazon just moves sales from Walmart to amazon

But the organisational changes needed to achieve this are profound and deep - building amazon was an amazing acheieneltnt - and it is in the organisational format that government follows - government invests stem for long term wealth creation (new forms tech) and business takes that invention and innovates new product forms and new organisational forms to distribute the created wealth (or rather wealth only creates when it is distributed)

As such my predilection got expenreinifn with governance forms in organisations - why Debian is a bigger idea than its distbuttion


social media - it turns out that social media was actually public publishing - (Zuckerbetgs pivot to person to person messaging) - and that newspapers were curators of publishing - journalism was about deciding what gets putinot oublic sphere.  

democratic journalism is important - social media was a way of allowing people to publish something important  (mexico drug wars) or crap (influencers) - somehow we need good ways to find facts and raise them to consciousness - a backlog of issues and a store of facts

As software eats the world it becomes part of the world - and so becomes *regulated*.
Software regulation is now just *politics* - its hard, complicated and needs
compromise and being infomred and active.


We start with a utopia - the CLuetrain manifesto.
And we start looking at privacy (ie secure / closed)

Governance and territotries and culture and events
--------------------------------------------------

If we can build products tailered to exact personal preferences, we
can also tailor products to countries laws and regulations.

The question is how much should we? How much is use of Whatsapp or
twitter a driver of social change (just as bicycles, trains, love
letters in postal service and Sears selling to american blacks).  It
becomes a question of choosing your balknisations?

Facebook newsfeed - just another media channel?  Filter bubble - not
as bubble as it used to be? (research) Behviour targetted ads vs
context targetted ads - howo well is duck duck go doing?  Fake News -
there has *always* been fake news. its just we were not listening to
every stupid pub conversation.

NYTimes::

Two months before the 1990 P.G.A. Championship at Shoal Creek and six years after the club hosted the 1984 P.G.A., Mr. Thompson responded to a question from a reporter for The Birmingham Post-Herald about Shoal Creek’s membership, which included Jews and women, by saying, "We don’t discriminate in every other area except blacks."

Yeah. We used to only see this shot if it made it into the NYTimes - now it's everywhere.  This is good because the amazing stuff is everywhere, it's just that the diamonds in river of shit metaphor still
leaves a river of shot. one day they will learn - this is cultural colonisation that white men complain about.  







Opportunities - MOOP, agent moderated life, what about an app that
says "hey, you know that comment your friend just made about Flat
Earth. Majority of scientific opinion accepts earth is a sphere
floating in space - here is a photo".  Or "You know your father just
said Gays and Faggots will burn in Hell, here is ... well you get the
point"

Imagine not merely access to all the world's knowledge, but access
mediated by a Medical-level ethically driven moderation.

But what if it is not ethically driven? How do we know what is being told to us?
This should itself be extractable.

Look at graduates of today - well adjusted renaissance people with little desire / experience to kill maim.

Was this how we imagined the future in 1800? No - yet we are what changed more than the world - we could not take the 1750 mindset into a car / modern world - it's not a question  of technical skills - it's about character and attitude 

it's basically why putin cannot take his country further - it's the reason the drunk cannot crawl out of the bottle.

It's about choice.

Science funding and support
----------------------------

Are we seeing drop off in support for science and technology? Well, poets don't tend to compose eulogies for scientists buried in st. paul's very much like Newton? (maybe hawking?)

We are seeing explanation exponent change

what makes rocket ships go up - funding makes rockets go up - no bucks no buck rogers.

Funding comes from support - which comes from understanding why the next step counts - this is education

I am doing important experiments for kids and Inam 500 years behind !!

education funding comes first

Statistical socialist
---------------------
I am a statistical socialist - i believe that every human being born in the planet is born within a narrow normal distribution for all of their attributes - intelligence, height, weight, good looks and sexual size (!) - and where their life outcomes are greater than the range of their distribution i believe those outcomes are influenced more by structural and systemic factors, and then by their character 


Rise (return) of curation
--------------------------
Death of the newsfeed 
https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/4/2/the-death-of-the-newsfeed
Newsfeed is going as facebook signals peer to peer focus (snapshot stories taking their toll)
But this implies rise again of journalism - who do i follow which leads to newspapers with opinions - but at least they are open accountable opinions (cf murdoch scandals)

It's going to be around picking out sample bias really really well

Seems to me to create multiple models using random selections of same training sets and then see if models come up with similar answers - can build statistical models around that.

Predistribution

Roberto Unger - changing the market structure of it is unfair so that redistribution is not always swimming up stream

Progressive politics seems to be engaged in harm reduction for their opponents 

Brexit
------
The big takeaway here is the constraining of executive powers on international scene - Uvettee cooper oliver lwtwin bill - seen in congress refusing to ratify treaties with dubbya - this is greater recognition of gloablisation - not just trade between boundaries but with services and regulation a merging and porous nature of boundaries  - and a search for legislative approval - a search for democratic approval against executive power - truly reflecting the new power balance infra companies

We have well tested ways of using science to discover facts

we have ways of using engineering science to discover facts about machines

we are starting to use those lessons to run software system
then we shall use same engineering and statistical principles to find facts on the rest of the pyroamid - how to better run organisations 
and then societies

and we shall do so if we choose the right metrics to be guided by

Tech and economics drive certain things
- shakespeare was not a tech change but an economic change - the cities were now big enough to support a permanent home (cf spanish similar person and wembley arena, and the first writer of all those ideas )

what are the changes coming? micro and macro - nuclear war with korea or opioid crisis, prison crises

maybe software can help us identify and follow up on the small the micro, the forgotten

Poker lessons for life
http://m.nautil.us/issue/55/trust/the-resulting-fallacy-is-ruining-your-decisions

given a fair coin we can know the probability of heads to .5, but we cannot know the next outcome.  so we can place bets on 2/1 but we should not let the outcome upset us

focus on the process, so the outcomes eventually fall our way - it's a process of building a house advantage 

software enables us to more consistently run the process (think software in finance) and increase our throughout this increasing chances of total number of heads 


brexit and regulatory alignment 
there is a presumption that regulatory distinctiveness is beneficial - that we would offer something special

it's hard to imagine what - we all want iphones and advanced composite materials or biotech medicine - and the benefits of common open protocols in those areas are manifest, and the obvious adavantages of being a new different  one are minimal

using Amazon queu services
Not the GP author, but he's talking about using 4 different AWS services in a particular architectural pattern. SNS topics give you a triggering mechanism to start the long running task. Step Functions give you light-weight flow control and state management, but don't directly perform any interesting work. Instead, the step function steps can invoke Lambda functions or jobs in Elastic Container Service to do the actual work. When they finish, the step function can move on to the next step or retry things as needed

The new organisational form



Digital Advertising and the NSA 

this is "getting carried away with data"

It stopped being advertising some time ago (ad vert - latin /old drench make aware of)

This is an best and informative role -  rand awareness etc. yes it was inefficient but the ability to serve a different t advert to every person aka cambridge analytics is  it advertising - it's something else - behaviour driven point of sale prompting 

So i hate those supermarkets that put little sweets in front of the checkout  - you, CEO of asda, have just decided to make me disappoint my child and guard tee i say no five times - for and extra few pence if prom then if i cave - and oh yes dental cares and liver dies

But not this fucking rack of sweets can follow me around my whole digitisl life, shuffling sweets with lawnmower parts, new shirts and so on.  nothing I want nothing laid out for me in an informative or curated way  - just random shit

And this is Poor Tech. it is possible to curate the products of the world - to add age then in their use to me, to analyse my digital behaviour and drop a twenty second video explaining why the Park would be a great day out, suggest a list of sandwich fillings available on offer at tesco and remind my facebook group that the weather is not taking and i will be there about 13:00

That's the sort of useful stuff we want

the rest of the crap you can keep 


- advertising is just slow subscriptions sent to someone else 


The new coasian equilibrium

My conjecture is that firm size will now be determined by the ability to let the firm run without change - steady state. the software itself can reprogram itself (only to its own regulatory and business limits)

human managers ustifiy their jobs on changing the company - but profits come form

UCLA Law Review, Vol. 67, No. 2, 2020

last resort)



Measuring Outcomes
see accelerate but basic thing we want to do is have a commit of code, linked to a ticket, and that links to *expected* changes to known business kpis - for example sales funnel or speed of production of the accountancy report or ... so to prove it value in business need to measure business outcomes like we measure graphemes 

this is my next book - measuring impact on business outcomes 



Heyak and Moops 
---------------
Hayek has technologist driven societies - but not technology determined - we will have surveillance technology but how we use and live in it matters

MOOP is medicine - putting rights and indeed the best interests of the patient first - it is for us to choose how to - be more open more transparent more 

We have a poor record of fighting wars of freedom as a species - but being a shining beacon seems to work better 

Shelter under our guns but build your own society
 

Dissonance and Programmabke company
----------------------------

Programmable company offers the idea of a fast reacting company able to put manoeuvre completions

But 

Most organisations contain within them enormous dissonance e or hypocracy - and manage that through not explicitly stating or deciding one side vs other

Software won't let you do that

you will have to decide

The old "kill driver or little girl" is first part. What bout bribery. What about use of lithium cobalt from congolese mines.  What about ??? 
 


Imprimatur 
----------
The problem with youtube is the name youtube.com

it lends credibility to a video hosted 

it pretends to give video hosting but then hosts the surround on youtube .commso you cannot tell crap from not

if everyone had to run their own domain and youtube literally hosted in an ifeame then much of the problems would be solved - who would go to "backwoodsnazi.com" for videos on donald trump

the problem is we no longer have address - it's like everyone is available to talk to. whereas it was just a big town square now it's a big town square and everyone wears a youtube mask so you cannot see who they are

we used to have a mainstream based on the weighted distance of travel from "normal" thought - a sort of gravity of ideas and world view

but we have flattened the gravity
this is bad - society used to work on we all agreed where gracvoty was - we all knew the most mass coase we were there.  Sometimes we needed mass movements to help fix things like civil rights.  but at least it was obvious it was going on

now ... we cannot tell where gravity is because any idea carries same weight - because it is equally easy to get to.

free speech needs to be weighted - and skeptics needs to be taught.

so we need to make ideas harder to reach? seems dubious.


Far Far Beyond Facebook
-----------------------

Facebook and Google are, with some wriggle room, advertising billboard companies - like wikipedia they won't run out of pages 

But this is just the beginning

Software and the platform of the internet is beginning to change everything - we think for the ... fairer 

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23783871

Just look - as incidences of abuse occur they are recorded and cataloged and noticed

And where reality is at odds with perceived reality things start to change - even something as deeply ingrained as segregation in USA

Curate or extreme
-----------------
facebook - top ten articles each week kevin ruse nyt- right wing articles popular 
if fb does not curate it will get dragged by users - in USA that's to the right - it may be diff on spanish speaking site but the algorithm will learn what used want and drive more people off

or just become what should be - postings by your friend - xmas cars list 

In Ghosting the News by () she showed that local US governments that have strong local newspapers have lower borrowing costs - because they can get away with less corruption and so are more trustworthy - we need the watchdog role.

Other issues around curation
-----------------------------
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23881315

Also  on same podcast, people were not aware that their congressman had been indicted for insider trading. They did not get local news on tv or newspaper but via facebook etc.  So there is a need for facebook citation algorithm to be better serving democracy

this can be fairly easily achieved with regulation similar to UK public food licenses

but also a algorithm  that allows following curated editors (ie bbc news feed) and allowing meta citation - popping up more highly meta news feeds 

Meta-curation
--------------

We want more competition in the field (for example we want more completion on twitter so that one hack does not threaten national security - see schneier on july 20 jack)

The feed algorithm will become regulated and politically hijacked - it will need to have an open solution so that while personalisabke it is also curated and regulated - hard to do but feasbikle - like choosing which newspaper to read you choose which set of lies to believe


Scale scale scale
-----------------
What really makes difference in valuation is scale of the market today - 4/5bn people? facebook has 50% of market (really - has in what sense ?)

The scale of dealing with certain things is enormous and we have few tools - double down on democracy 


The death of Neo Lineralism 
---------------------------
rethinking capitalism - need a new vision

Politics modern not have much of a vision - but slowly economics is recovering and finding new 

- libertarian paternalism 

We can see a new software enabled world guided by more accurate maps of our behavioural world

It can be one of greater egalitarianism (70k each remember) but it is something we need to build the technology, ensure the regulation is in place and always guide the car 

sadly there is not automatic driving for the politics journey 


Big companies the world
over
--------------------
https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/07/23/Not-an-Amazon-Problem

Fixing a amazon is like fixing the East aindia company - it eventually took the government to take over its role with different incentives and vague idea of fairness and decency and slowly eroded - that and ghandi 

The economy is not what you think it is
---------------------------

it's not GDP - measurement issues 
productivity - you cannot measure online banking in GDP cos it has not a cost like a human teller 


Against UBI
-----------
Neo liberal tosh
you cannot use it to pay for collective public services - UBI won't pay for a bus service to your town or for better schools

we need to choose the common decent floor - schools and transport and food and pay for it through decent wages and smart public works - avoid the car first

what about the world where jeff bezos owns everything and the factories are robots.  Maybe ... we face that then 


Also if MMT is right (seems like it) then government can simply use its printing power to purchase all unemployment in the economy - effectively UBi but done through employment and is a safety net plus allowing gov to build public goods - working in terrible job - hey go work for the gov on minimum wage building a road 



The decreasing returns to scale of saas apps
-----------------------
This is why Devmanual is a good idea

How to regulate tech? 
set up best practises like devmanual and move forward? 

Also territories are going to have to find whose rules apply? is apple or amazon as big as they can get or do they have to break up to serve their different teritories? For apple making hardware that will be somewhat easier but privacy rules and data demands will likely have to split - just to be able to keep to certain demands for hosting of data 

but amazon could see real splits - workers rights and so on will make consistency harder ?? 

And we shall have to see how conflicts in regulations are played out - who decides ultimately - The eu court? Brexit showed that a lot of people in a nation don't like those ideas or don't trust the federalising ? 

Regulation and security
- the report on russian interference on british elections basically showed the security services dropping the ball/asleep at wheel

this won't happen again - but let's look at known security incidents in big tech - twitter has saudi employees working for saudi agencies. twitter big hack is huge wake up call.

At some point the security services will enforce minimum security standards on big tech - possibly full sdlc.  but the basics will be hugely crippling impact for example inability to change products to meet demand.

but what rules get applied - can the CIA trust a chinese national on the Support team? 

It is worth nothing that a smartphone is carried by every person is a spying device and a encryption and identity device.


IOT and open software - the hill to die on
-----------------------------

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24023787



Advertising is dead
--------------------
Both ends are losing money 
Facebook trying to do attribution but that's not the same thing
brand advertising 
advertising is wrong model - it was a brand advert and signal (arbitrage shanks).  but online advertising is mixing up
- discovery
- search
- advertising

Review sites are most powerful thing - facebook should overwhelming win but some sort of near field smart app and and a rfid chip review site will be awesome socks

MOOP - what happens when users of the "app" become better, more sex more money happier children? everyone will want it - this is not advertising - this should be a medical app - and regulated as such.  It should give advice under regulation.  And that advice will not be advertisabke - must be privacy law. but we have those. 


Shaping the community
---------------------

Open source code is created by one for the many - and paid for by whom? 

Tithe? 

What about foundations that pay for creation of code in their image - TOR and other sources 



When did software become obviously vulnerable 
----------------------

If any hack made it's way into the mainstream consciousness over the last decade, it was WannaCry. It introduced a mainstream audience to the concept of ransomware and, because of the impact it had on critical hospital equipment, showed just how far software has embedded itself into our society.

---------------------

discusses unbundling of education but it will happen to rest of society as software eats world and online activity / virtual world 

means virtual world will tie more expressly to real world - in a mmoprg the programmers own all the land and rent seeking - but if we agree a means to tie it to land we have degree of control - or rather the domain name is the land - and amazon is just seen as selfridges 

err? 

other issues

farming??? 

What about stock market - the solution to auditors and SEC and so on is to unbundle knowledge - a stock market where all sales and data is released daily is ... going to allow people to trust those they want to trust - cottage industry in spotting fakes (german wirecard) and make shorting an actual thing - money would flow as easily away from short targets as to them 

(major struxturela issue)
