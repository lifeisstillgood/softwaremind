=============================
Brands, styles and UI Design
=============================

I am going to take a minute

There is a common view of a `brand` as an anondyne, meaningless set of words.
This is because the big examples of branding are from big, huge companies - the Fortune 500 as it were. With very very few exceptions these companies are not one singular compabies with one singular, opinionated view of the world - they are to all intents and purposes many different companies under one location - like cats in a burlap sack (or perhaps more charitably, performaers under same circus tent)

As such finding one voice, or logo or style that encompasses all of these disparate companies is hard.

House of brands - but then the logic for the parent company wanes considerably.
Unilever may like multiple types of washing powder,

Brands and companies work best as singular usually aspirational offerings - Apple, Starbucks.

The simplest approach - themeing.
THe one that gets us off the ground fastest is to take existing style and
adjust the theme as needed.

Existing theme: Bootstrap, with widgets
Logo, colours,
widgets




.. epigraph:: Start with the User Need

User Interface Design, at least at the levels of "I want my small
Enterprise App to be useful", is pretty simple.

It needs four components

1. Visual Style
2. Consistent base HTML elements
3. Higher Level Design patterns incl. behaviour
4. That extra dash of style

We have three levels, style-core, style-pkg, style-xp
This way we have manageable paths for different discussions to grow.
eXPerimental styles, or interactions, the CSS and the JS for them
go into these packages.

If after a tryout the XP stuff works, it

I have several different bits in different levels.  My core is used
everywhere, for each client.  pkgs usually get pulled in, but are there to
overwrite things like bootstrap date pickers.

Extra Dash of Something
-----------------------

Here is where I bow out.  I can do an "alright" job with the leverage of things
like colorwheels, bootstrap, and a bit of common sense.  But I am not pixel
perfect obessive with a mental memory of thousands of interactive sites, the
deep understanding of design, trade-offs, a finger on the pulse of the
`zeitgeist` and the ability to mix all these into one intuitive expression of
your company's essence.

That's why you hire a professional.  But you can do a lot before you get there,
which is lucky, 'cos the good ones are expensive :-)
