The Software Mind
==================


Why
===

There is a lot written about *how* to create software and
software teams.

This book is about *why* the how is how it is.  The *why* needs
both the *right point of view*, and the history of how we got here.

So this book is at best, an opinion piece - informed by over twenty years "in the trenches" of software development.  

I call this *why*, The Software Mind.  The *how* is The Dev Manual.


=================
Software Literacy
=================

I'm standing in a cavernous room underneath a bustling, noisy pub in
London's Covent Garden.  It was a fine Summers day and the evening is
sharply cooking.

I look around at the 90-odd developers, graduates and entrepreneurs in
the room, and, as I have been persuaded to sponsor this meeting, now
all I have to do is give a quick speech.

I never quite know what to do for these sort of speeches - so I decide
to give a history lesson. Yes. A history lesson. Gripping stuff, some
were even rolling their eyes in excitement.

It's a good one though. You see, in 1454, Johannes Gutenberg printed
the first of his Bibles using movable type - and ushered in a new era
of literacy and communication. Printing books was now orders of
magnitude cheaper, and there was an explosion of publishing.

The number of published books leapt from an estimated 30,000 books *in
all of Europe in 1450* to 12 million books by 1500.  Think about
that. A decent sized library today, in many large towns in England
will have 30,000 books.  More than were in the whole of Europe before
the printing press. [#]_

Within a generation literacy in Western Europe had leapt from under 2%
to well over 20% - and it changed everything. Martin Luther was able
to nail a piece of paper to a church door and expect most members of
the middle-class congregation to simply read it, not have it read to
them by clergy. Books on mathematics and navigation enabled the
training of middle-class merchantmen who would then dare, only 40
years later, to cross the Atlantic.

Literacy en mass changed the course of human history and gave a tiny
corner Eurasia some huge advantages the effects of which are only just
wearing off five centuries later.

Before people wandered off to the bar I decided to let them know why
they were getting my best Simon Scharma impression.

Because, in my view, and remember they were eating my sausage rolls,
so that counts, in my view we are entering the age of a new form of
literacy - *software literacy.*

Even in the 15th century, nations, companies and guilds and churches
competed, and ran international concerns. But somewhere between
Gutenberg's Bible and Luther's 95 Theses these companies changed. Not
with business process re-engineering, or total quality circles - but
changed like leaving the water and walking on land changed. I have no
idea how to quantify the advantages a company whose staff can all read
and write will have over a company whose staff are illiterate. It's
not one of lower labour cost, or better marketing, it's something
else...Deep in our bones we *know* that literacy changes everything.
Its so built into us and into everyone we know that we cannot imagine
a world where we cannot read or write.

Anyway, you, like the poor people wanting to get to the bar, can see
where I am taking this. The ability to marshal knowledge, to code and
compile and compute, the natural inclination to arrange the world so
it can be iterated over, the ability to turn a business from a
medieval scriptorium into an automated system is software literacy.

The final shape of a software literate company is probably unguessable
to us, in the same way that an airports departures board was
unguessable to Pope Pius II, or that a major newspaper run by
illiterate editors will look and work nothing like the Washington
Post. But we can be sure they are coming. And we can make sensible
predictions about what they will and won't be.

Now I used to feel smug about my nice little Printing Press literacy
theory (it was a while ago).  But I remember attending `Sprint 16` the
UK's Government's tech fest, and the Cabinet Office Minister standing
up and spouting pretty much the same concept.  Nothing stops smugness
like a national politician using your lines.

But the thing is, we are both right.  Although his suit was
better.


And so, as the Meetup wanders back to the bar slightly shocked, we
wander back to our theme.

Computers have been turning up everywhere, except in the productivity
statistics. And I think I know why.  We are living in an age of
computing enabled *communication* but not in a *software literate* age
- and the benefits we expect only come from literacy, not
communication.

To stretch my analogy too far, *having* books at all enables communication,
but *having* a literate populace enables companies to redesign themselves
internally, to alter without everyone already understanding. To *optimise*

The internet already enables mass communication, but between software
illiterate people, so any benefits of software just drain away -

Only when a critical mass of people in a company are software literate
can that company hope to become *programmable*.

THe software mind is our programmers minds, But it is also the
controlling mind of a company - an organisation and eventually a
civlisaation

NB: civilisation is a socialist endeavour.


.. sidebar:: The First Tech Revolution

   It is worth noting that about 50,000 years before Gutenberg, humans
   invented another world changing technology - a spoken language.  It
   became possible to communicate abstract ideas. Beyond "danger" we
   could achieve "danger from tiger tomorrow" - and our brains evolved in
   step with our language to cope.

   To look at it another way - for 50,000 years we coded up one single
   release of a single parser / interpreter - the human brain.  The
   written word became a hard drive to store code on, and Gutenberg
   invented distributed networking.

Socrates Socialism and capitalism
=================================

I am trying to make a point - its not terribly clear what the point is
but its worth remebering that is is really quite useful to view
software as *capital*.  Capital is best defined as an asset we own
that returns money to the owner, directly or enabling other assets to
do so.

Roads, railways, air pollution regulation, scientific publishing and
more are all *shared*. Paid for by taxaation, laid down as forms of capital
like Ancient aqueducts and used.

Yes rentiers do take unfair shares.


The leads us to Data.

Data is a new form of value - before computers, data had great value - but it was limited. Like gold the cost of surveillance made prohibitive the mass collection - look at Stasi.
But now we have found a way to turn lead into gold.  THe new tech firms have taken this data.

Now we shall start to see it laid down as capital. As public goods.

But rather than regulation *solely* perhaps the best approach will be to
use IP law.

If I write a book, for example, or even a web post, a tweet or even an email, that collection of words is (UK / US / Most western law) assumed to have *automatically* my ownership over it (I do not have to assert copyright seperately to the act of creation / publication.

THe words in my email are *created* by myself. But the metadata around it, the time of the email, whom it was sent to, even perhaps other derivable data such as my tonality, my location at time of sending, and then where I could not have been as well. All this is not presumabled to be mine automatically. 

It is not going to be a huge stretch to assign ownership to that meta data - to the data footprint.  And if I own that data that others are hoovering up,
what right do they get to use it and what cost to me.

Now this is not a perfect framework - but it does have some advantages.
Public commons.

Locking data up in private silos is not the solution.
GIve it a price and it will find a way to become capital again.????

   

The software literate company, and the programmable company
-----------------------------------------------------------

Software literacy for a company does not mean that it just hires a lot
of programmers, and calls the job done.  That's been happening for a
long time and yet few companies manage to evolve.  I am hoping to
describe in this book a vision of a company *that does not exist yet*.

A truly literate company, in a world of other truly software literate
companies.

We cannot know for sure the shape such companies will take - they will
jostle and change in a complex dance of evolution, but we can look at
both positive and negative data we have today - how companies have
failed to act in a sane / literate manner, and how some fundamentals
of software literacy are shining thru and will be unavoidable in the
future.



.. figure:: /_static/all-the-presidents-men.png
   :width: 75%

   When I speak of a literate company, please keep this film in mind.

'All the President's Men' is one of my favourite films, engrossing and
suspenseful.  And it also portrays life in a deeply literate company.

I will take a leap and argue that the Washington Post under Ben
Bradlee was the epitome of a (non-software) literate company.  It had
well trained professionals, clear ethical standards, clear business
processes and clear processes for ensuring that its literate output
met their standards. Editors and copy-sub-editors and so on.  Oh, and
cash-flow. That helped a lot.

I suggest that even companies like tech-behemoth Google are not really
software literate ... yet. But the clues are there. In the excellent
SRE book (link) author (link) the "founder" of SRE in Google, defines
SRE as "SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design
an operations team".  As we go forward we shall find the software
literate companies are what happens when software engineers design
(found, run, populate and evolve) companies.  The flush of unicorns
today in Silicon Valley are nearly software literate - the effort of
founding a company is so huge that it's hard to believe that what
results is what a software engineer would design. Things get missed.
But each generation of companies will steal from previous until the
majority of a company is what would be designed.

Does it make a difference - well let's compare the old "knowledge
company" and the new. In 2012 `Google` had a revenue of $50bn and a
workforce of 40,000 - whereas the finance house `Barclays
International` also had a revenue of $50bn, but a far larger workforce
of 120,000.  Fast-forward to 2016 and `Google` has grown to $89bn and
70,000 people.  In the same year of 2016, `Bank Of America` posted
revenues of $89bn, and a workforce of over 200,000 people.  There are
many caveats comparing these numbers, but all the firms involved are
resolutely "knowledge-based" - the core processes of the firms do not
involve smelting iron ore or manufacturing cars.  And yet `Google`
carries 2/3 less humans for same revenue at each stage.  One of them
has used software in a markedly different manner.

One of them has become more *software literate*.

Software literacy will become part of the core fabric because software
is core to why the world is changing - because software allows us to
more precisely express and then share the models in our heads.  So if
my model in my head says that the life of a child crossing the road is
more valuable than the driver of a Tesla, then perhaps one day I will
vote on a software pull request ...

Follow the Literate
-------------------

When I started in the Internet world the truism then was 'follow the
young'.  Young people then were drinking in pubs (of course) but using
digital cameras to record the night, and uploading the pictures to a
web page later that evening so everyone could see the next morning.
And they did so listening to MP3s played out of the PCs speakers.
Which in 1995 was *prescient*.

But it turned out that was not what young people were doing.  It was
what softeare literate young people with access to fixed line internet
were doing.

The rule should have been, and still is, if you want to understand how
software is eating the world, follow the software literate person - a
company built by a literate person full of other literate people will
look different to anything else before.


Be opinionated
--------------

In my opinion, Software is best when it is *opinionated*
That is that the software has a world view built into it - not merely in the
apis or the configuration, but the choices of architecture, in its bones.

This opinion is like the "voice" that novels and writers aim to develop - and in my utterly unsubstantiated view, will be a good portion of brand of a programmable company - an universally configurable company that could be anything will simpley end up being nothing to anyone.

In short a programmable company is going to have a limited phase space - a set of directions it could take, but also options it cnanot take without breaking its own voice.  In short if you want to turn Virgin Records into Coutts Bank, its not going to be a simple config file upload.



Why are companies big or small?
-------------------------------

This might seem a silly question, obviously the more successful
companies get bigger.  But that means you have to share the loot with
more people - so if you could run a company completely automatedly,
you would so you would not share the revenue with any one.  So the
extra people must be there for a good reason.  But you would not add
*more* people than needed.  That would cut the amount of loot to go
round.  So there must be counter-veiling forces, pushing and pulling
for hiring or reducing people.

The British Mid-Century Economist Roald Coase came up with a *theory of
the firm* to explain this struggle - that a firm size (number of
employees) is an equilibrium between getting your work done through
external contracts, and getting the work done internally by employees.

Coase's Theory of the Firm says that the *transaction costs* of each
(ie finding a external provider, verifying they are secure, can meet
your needs, versus training up a new employee) determine the total
cost of providing a service, and so determine whether it is better to
hire a new employee rather than looking out for a contract provider.

So when we look at Google v Barclays we can *intuit* that the 2/3 of
the old style firm is making up for the missing automation.  And that
about 1/3 of the old firm is then a combination of people not yet
automated away and people changing the firm (ie adding new automation
to do new parts of the job).

Now of course, software and the internet is changing these transaction
costs, and so changing the equilibrium point of firms sizes.  And as
firm sizes change, they change governance structures as well.  The
trend looks to be *smaller*.  But to really take advantage of Coase's
theory, a firm needs to be more than automated, it needs to be
*programmable*.

  Copernicus principle and democracy 
   -----------------------------------

  see talking politics but if we see end of our short mass participation
  democracy - what will replace it? remember electronic voting cannot
  work so the easy answer is wrong

  searching for a world where we have different models but models are
  review-able. models can be represented in code. and if we tell our
  agent what we want (Nobel prize win) we get optimal outcomes

  start to smell a programmable company and programmable society where
  our wants are explicit and modelled and actions review-able - and best
  interests are kept (mid term democracy) - and moop exists to help us
  deal with it (see slabscsoe drugs to stop worrying)

  (can expand but is seperate section)

Just what is a programmable company?
------------------------------------

.. figure:: /_static/portrait_of_merchant_jan_gossaert.png
   :width: 75%

   A dutch 16th century trader pointing at his accounts books
   Jan Gossaert (Washington National Gallery)
   
The 16th Century Trader shown above is writing in an accounting book,
and has hanging behind him his accounts for the past venture.  As a
portrait like this would be outrageously expensive, and so it is is a
good example of how proud rich merchants were of their new "system" -
accounting. Yes, 500 years ago, accountants were cool.  It was cool
because it was a way to control companies in a *very nearly*
programmatic way.  By setting limits to how subordinates could behave
by setting budgets, and by being able to monitor how successful they
were through budgets, a company could be controlled, or perhaps I
should say *programmed* to behave in certain ways. Companies could be controlled by telling people what to do, but by setting and altering budgets, they could be (in a limited sense) programmed. They were and are a slow form of AI [#stross1]_ 



By the industrial revolution accounting had become globally accepted
and slowly standardised, and after the 1950s Management Accounting had
been invented / popularised by consultants like Bain, but now Software is
bridging the physical world and the virtual more granular than
previously.

And this is my definition of a programmable company - where all
processes are visible in the virtual world - where the levers can be
pulled at a more granular level, and feedback controlled more
precisely, through software.  This is not *entirely* about replacing
people with robots.  Years ago as a student I worked as a Warehouse
Picker, ripping a perforated sheet off a printer, walking up and down
aisles filling crates and loading crates onto lorries to be shipped
out.  If the Software told me to load 6 bottles of Johnny Walker,
that's what I did.  I may have been slow, surly and occasionally
hungover, but I was entirely programmable.  Think of me as a student
Marvin the Paranoid Android, with a similar pain in my diodes down the
left side

I expect warehouse robots *have* now replaced my erstwhile colleagues, but
they are no more programmable than we were. But the marketing
department for the giant Distillery firm had employees to run their
recruitment drives, had employees to complete payroll, had employees
to sort out our shifts and employees to decide what adverts to send to
what companies to sell their services.

All of those were not programmable jobs back in my student days
(sometime after Napoleon's exile) - but many have become so today.
Payroll has been automated for a long time, but Software-as-a-Service
companies offer end to end recruitment services that can be turned on
or off as easily as when I ripped a A4 sheet of perforated paper.
SaaS companies offer mobile apps that let people swap their shifts
around, and still meet local working time regulations, and A/B testing
has fundamentally moved advertising and marketing away from "brilliant
creative endeavours" and into "try this and measure its affect".
Funnel optimisation is a real thing.

So automation is eating away at pretty much everything. Surely at some
point we can *automate all the things*, and have a gazillion dollar
company run by one woman part-time?


It is a trope that it is much cheaper to start a Start-up now than in
the early 2000s.  But it is cheaper to *run* a company of almost any
size if it is automated.  The amount that companies are / will spend
on "Robot Process Automation" (ie screen scraping and replacing back
office staff) is a major growth area today.

But automating processes is not the whole story for a programmable company.
There seem to be four components - trust-able data, models / what if planning,
automation of processes, good governance.

What aspects of Coasian Transaction Costs are being changed by software?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For me the single biggest transaction cost left is *data management*.
No this is not "stick it on a disk", but data about data.  What data
do we have, what does it mean, who produced it, when, how does that
data fit into our models and suddenly there is a *lot* of work
involved.

There are signs this matters because Chief Information Officers
regulalrly sit on company boards - as a sign that at board level no
one has any reliable data and does not know what is going on and
therefore creates a high level post to just sort it out.

In short the cost of *trusting* data is one of the biggest single
transaction costs between using internal employees and internal data
sources and using external (cheaper) data sources.

Data that is generated from inside the company is implicitly trusted
(even perhaps if it should not - see later points on fake news and
fake project management), but data from outside the company needs
filtering, transforming etc.  However the impact of external *ledgers*
(with the Blockchain as the poster boy ledger) will change what can be
trusted.

Walmart and Tesco are sometimes described as companies only possible
after the creation of the Relational Database - they built internally
trustable supply chains - but if that supply chain is now placed on a
Blockchain ledger - If you can see the supply chain from factory to
shop, for every SKU in your shop, then the vast web of databases and
processes Walmart (or Amazon) has built are ... legacy.

Similarly encryption technologies, and zero-knowledge encryption
especially, will start to impact on where data can be stored and
manipulated.  Trusting a third party to hold your data, is a big cost
(unless of course you are an individual in which case Google and
Facebook and the advertising industry just hoover it up relentlessly,
... ranting again.  Look its hard to read I know but just imagine what
its like to be in my head.  I have this stuff going on all the time.)

You see, encrypting your data and then working on it map-reduce style
on rented machines and re-encrypting it when finished is likely to be
a growth model.

Additionally the willingness to outsource wholesale services to SaaS
companies shows that data management is loosely held. (I mean the
timesheets and payrolls of employees is not only sensitive but
competitively useful, but hardly any company does this in-house
anymore.)

The *serverless* software model has some compelling financial and
flexibility arguments.

As data, and more importantly meta-data is managed at a first class
level in companies we shall see a huge shift in what can be offloaded,
outsourced etc.

What is the political environment around data
---------------------------------------------

* Facebook / bcklash
* Data that I create dhould eb like copyright - I own it.
* we seeing this direction of travel with GDPR
* as such control of the pedigree of data, and the costs of handling data
will increase and see ledger changes


Software applied to Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a truism in software engineering - its better to have few
simple data structures and complex operations on them, then many
complex data structures and few operations.

.. pull-quote::

   (have the Brooks quote on show me your data model)

Having got data under control, companies need to start managing their
*processes*.

You would be amazed at how much duplication of work and processing,
how much different understandings of what a piece of data is or means
goes on inside every large corporation.

Let me give you a quick example.  Actually 2 examples.

(I *love* Monzo. They are a challenger bank. 
Banking. New banks, the Monzo Beta issue.)

So even if we have data under control, the messy evolved system
internally to a company




Director Hazing
---------------

Large companies have evolved *horrific* internal processes.  Just as
Monzo learnt, I hope, somethings need extra checks.  Now Hopefully
Monzo has written tests that prevent them sending changed statements.
Automated tests.

But that is extra grist. A new sign off. After many years, (and not
enough automation of sign offs and checks!) the system just becomes
"what we have always done" and usually someone tries to get a Big
Important Consultancy in to fix it which of course means a crazier,
overly configureable system with no *opinions* and now no one
understands it.

In other words internal processes become really messy relly quickly.

And companies need internal middle management that understand how to
get things done in that mess. So they hire talented, clever people at
middle management level (in the US model this is the Director level).
And what every new Director in every major company discovers is that
their first six months are *hell*.

Whereas signing off payroll or ordering new pencils or agreeing a
budget was something your boss did, now you have to learn how to do it
- and that means learning that "the ARCP system needs a Green approval
in the TENDER system before you can get the PMO to OK the release of
funds for NCD".

And this happens hundreds of times a day.  You either learn to swim,
or you sink - fast.  Those who swim are now in line for the real
tournament to the top.

I call this Director Hazing.  The total mind-fuck that learning
pointless systems trivia unique to one company, so that you can simply
*function*.  And doing it at a hundred decisions a day speed.  And
because the older hands had to do it, they are quite happy to see the
younglings go through the same pain. It did them good afterall.

But, is the skill to be able to manually make hundreds of tiny actions
a day, to navigate the crazy internal systems, to manage the hundreds
of people you have, is that *necessary* or is that contingent on the
lack of automation?

Are the skills Director Hazing selects for, the skills a Programmable
Company needs?


Finally, if we have a programmable company it can do an amazing thing.
Controlling a company through accountancy and budgets was
impressive. It allowed empirical testing of ideas (give this section
this much budget and see what happens)

But it lacked ... predictive capabilities.

But if you have a programmable company, where the processes are
explicit in code, then you also have a *modellable* company.  One that
can have its code brought up in a safe environment, and run against
different scenarios and tested for failures - and optimisations.

This does already happen - integration tests of systems perform
what-if analysis on systems (just like what Knight Capital did not
do).  But testing environments look for failures.  New modelling
environments will look for optimisations.

And optimisations may not meet the needs or wants of the people in the
company.  For example shift patterns in places like Starbucks have
been seeing "optimisation", and leading to issues like people being
given 3 hours in the morning and then told to leave (unpaid) for a few
hours then get a few hours in the afternoon.  This of course plays
havoc with any real persons life.  It has seen a lot of push back.

And that push back, that *political decision* to not do an optimised
change, to not follow the A/B test down a path, that is governance.
That is how does a programmable company, that can run itself without
human decision making, and that can through modelling, change itself,
how does that company change in ways that benefit us. By having a
controlling mind, that decides which changes are good or bad.

And this last is the essence of Uber, AirBnB, Facebook and google -
how they have affected our world and how regulations are trying to
steer that affect.


It is subtle in some cases this regulatory arbitrage. For example the
nightmare videos on YouTube have two issues - 1. as YouTube avoids
being a publisher it is not responsible for content - but if it was
responsible it would have to find ways to curate the content.

2. yes it may not be possible to automatically review the content, the
copyright laws may not be enforceable at that scale (dubious) - but
frankly that's just a failure of business model not a technical
hurdle.

Nothing stops someone putting their own videos on line - YouTube
simply aggregates and collects rent


What about landscape - what are other companies doing.
------------------------------------------------------

(Notes on landscaping)


.. pull-quote::

  So we now have a couple of tools that will be useful in working out
  not only that software is eating the world, but what size and shape
  will the meals be.

Literate companies will be Lisp like - able to rewrite the virtual
data that represents their real-world actions, but also able to treat
their real-world actions as re-writable too. It was obvious how to
make a student warehouse picker change what he was doing
programmatically. It was less obvious how to make the head of
marketing do so.  A/B testing was the answer - or rather metrics were.



Fake News and Fake Project Management
-------------------------------------

The whole programmable company thing has two needs - it needs a body
(a corps or corporation) that does as it is told, and there has to be
a controlling mind. That controlling mind is the company governance.
At the moment it is a dictatorship of epic proportions. The CEO says
jump, 20,00 people say how high. But as more and more of us shift into
being programmed (like warehouse pickers or Marketing Directors) there
will be more demand to have influence over that controlling mind.

 When a company had barely accounting, and time between command and
affect was measured in time it took a ship to sail, company employees
had much autonomy.  This autonomy has been shrinking and shrinking,
till many employees are merely robots, ripping off perforated paper.
As this hits the middle class, middle management, then history tells
us middle classes demand representation at the top.  Demand democracy
in corporations.

I conjecture that we shall see more and more skilled people, the ones
who are usually "changing the company" will jump ship and run their
own smaller service providers.  But this kind of is happening as many
contractors will say.  But it is still a command and control
relationship. Smaller companies, with smaller transaction costs.



The programmable company
------------------------

For almost everything a company or organisation does a second time,
that can be automated or co-ordinated via software.  A company will
become a programmable entity.  Most if not all effort that goes into
today's software projects, goes not into creating new business logic,
but into finding the data, massaging it, guaranteeing it, handling
exceptions, and fitting into the rest of the businesses weird ways.

But a programmable company, that has robust exception handling, that
has open standards that are easy to fit into, that has trustable data,
is something else.  At a certain point, changing a company becomes a
matter of changing code.

What is a firm? A collection of processes, the handling of exceptions,
the culture? the human decision making?

There are 2 parts - running the company, and changing the company
Where BAU does not really involve human decision making we can see
automtion drop costs and increase speeds.

Trustable processes
-------------------

There is a lot of work on getting processes 'into the cloud' Putting
data up there securely, Future issues will include not leaking
competitive information Lots of work on Robot process automation.



Trusting data and firm size
---------------------------

I think there is another interesting way to look at Coase firm size -
its to do with the cost of *trusting data*.  If data is published
internally, or from a *trusted third party* (lets say Reuters) there
is a limited amount of double checking needed.  Rumour is aproblem in
all companies, but Fake News is not. But with smaller and smaller
companies, the cost of finding and *trusting* data increases.

The fight against fake news is going to be a long defining one in
years to come.  The most obvious way is simply to revert back to the
old saw "You can have your own opnion, but not your own facts". The
KGB lead approach to destroying this is to put so many fake facts, so
much chaff, that people just reinforce their own biases.  SOme method
to validate real geniuine facts against fake facts is within reach.
We can see how cameras could sign images, how articles published could
be cryptographically signed and stored, how facts marked up in the
text.

ANd so how news aggregators (sorry advertising companies) like Google
and Facebook could use that to mark fake news as such.

Some method to validate inferences from a *selection* of facts.  Well.
Thats harder. Hell, Human Politics might be defined as that problem.

As such the current privacy, GDPR world is not merely a lefty liberal
problem. It is a major factor in form size, market efficency and the
underlying fundamentals of

How do I know - well, as a software literate person, its just obvious.



New Project Management
----------------------

Is fake news really a problem inside companies. Let me tell you a
story. Names have been changed to protect the guilty

Project - codebase begins, insufficiency for purpose, no one admitting
to it because if so then get fired.  The project management process
allowed for ... lies. Yes it passes, kind of.  any outside scrutiny-
day by a news reporter - would trivially see a problem. But no the
fake news carries on up

size makes this harder simply because at each step the ability to take
time and challenge fake news is harder - and made worse by the culture
of productivity/ hazing of directors

so we need automated helpnto dosciver fake news in our own project reporting

and that means trusting / managing the code 

this inefficient is argued it is what brought down soviet - what all
doctoaros suffer from (see saudi air force) - and we love it in our
own companies??


We are already seeing calls for the software industry to regulate
itself, on privacy, on deals with repressive regiemes.  The answer is
not as simple as coders all being nice people.  But society needs to
regulate and also accept change.  We shall see that in section 2.

But companies, governments and organisations of every stripe, will
need to adapt to a new set of technologies that have a grain, a
direction of travel, ... a tidal force.  Those techologies are here
now, and our old organisational structures are no longer sufficent.

Lets look at it this way - Facebook, if it took all 1.5 BILLION users
and moved to a new land mass would be the worlds largest
country. Ever.

And it would be the least democratic. Ever. A one man dictatorship. No
law courts, no police, no constitution.  Nada.  And yet every Facebook
app-using citizen would have more daily contact (what 3 hours a day?)
with its "government" than they ever had with their proper
governments.

Each day we see some new controversy, YouTube failing to police its
comments section against paedophiles, (find more examples).  This is
not because Facebook is inherently evil, but because we are moving our
lives online - and *some* people moving online *are* inherently
evil. [#]_

So companies, governments, organisations, the structures we all spend
so much of our lives working within, need to change to get the best
out of the new technologial opportunity we face.

Because it could be a golden future for humanity.  Honest.


.. [#]:: OK, you might need to know a tiny bit about my political
      stance, which can be described as nice fluffy Euro-liberal until
      we look at Child Protection and I take a stance that makes
      Gengis Khan look like a big softie.  Anyway the important
      takeaway for this book is individual equality and market-led
      price discovery.

Trolley problem
===============

?
More and more software, more and more trolley problems
Britain got its knickers in a twist over one referendum - imagine how we would
deal with "kill kid or driver?"


Socrates and Economics
======================

THis is a divergance from the main discussion, so blip over if you like.
However i think this lays down a good argument

Economics is improved energy use for human utility
Socialsim / capitalsim
Shared capital - Romand aqueducts still csarrying water 2000 years later
All capitalism is is a foam on top of the capital helping us allocate scare resources in the quest to build new *shared* capital in our socialist utopia.

Socrates said so so it must be right.


We can see this in PG&E and Salt Lake Tribune
Salt lake tribune is now first local newspaper (pulitzer prize winnng)
to become a non-profit with IRS approval.  This is the start I feel of the migration of journalism from the "foam" of capitalism to the ocean of socialism -

compare this to the PG&E actions where they are turning off electircity to millions of users in case the electircity pylons fall over and start fires.

THe failure to put capital into burying the cables shows the failure of the foam to transition downwards.  


Governance and Software
================================

.. pull-quote::

  "Writing is nature’s way of showing us how sloppy our thinking is."
  Leslie Lamport

Writing down software shows you how sloppy your thinking was about the job in hand.

I very happily recounted my "Literacy started with the printing press,
software literacy starts with the Internet" meme in the last chapter.
I was rather proud of my little self, right up until I attended
`Sprint 16` the UK Government's annual conference on tech and software
and government.  And the Minister for the Cabinet Office stood up and
gave a keynote that was basically the speech I gave so many years
prior in a London pub basement.

Nothing stops you feeling smug like national politicians spouting the
same ideas as you.

But the thing is, we are both right.  Although his suit was better. 

The first mass-literacy revolution ran roughly in parallel with the
Commercial and Industrial Revolutions in Europe.  But apart from the
usual things we associate with literacy, things like sharing ideas
widely, democratic access to knowledge and so on, the one that is
often *missed* is that ideas have to be much more precisely expressed
when you write them down.  If you go around making speeches, each
person can walk off with different ideas as to what you said but
writing it down means it is waaay harder to mistake what you meant.

WIth software this applies to the n'th degree. There is no longer any
forgiving human mind in the way of your writing to work out what you
really meant. Software is unforgiving. The compiler will do what you
tell it.  And this means we shall have to write down what we really
mean.

This is going to be a problem.

- self driving car issue
- access to agorithms
- gorillas AI

Some computer vision AI software failed to see black women as human
faces - accurately reflecting the cultural make up of the AI
laboratory it sprang from.  And we shall have to solve the multiutude
of robotic actions in the real world that were previosuly left to
chance.  See the chapter on self-driving cars for example.

So software literacty is not just a nice fluffy teach the world to
code idea.  It is going to be a fundamental questioning of every
aspect of our society and assumptions.  And we will need much much
better at resolving those conflicts - large scale democratic politics
does not seem to be good at this. Although, as per Churchill, it is a
*lot* better than all the others.

I do not see this as some portent of doom. More that we are *already*
in a world too sophisticated for any one mind to understand.  We rely
utterly on the expertese, and indeed munificence of others.  Its just
that the procedures for all these are still hidden and opaque. Partly
because it is commercailly beneficial, but the vast majority of the
time it is just the processes have not been made into software, and so
are not accessible.


Some companies are more software literate than others. It is hard to
define this but we can see some outlines in the fog.  They are
basically around a quote from Googler <name> ::

       "SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design
        an operations team".

And we can extend that to ::

       "Software Literacy is what happens when you ask (a Western
       Political Liberal) Software Engineer to design a company"

I have dropped in the political leanings of the software engineer,
because that will come to matter, and beause i am doing the desigining
and it is always good to know thyself.

Lets have a look at what happens when Software Engineers do not design
a company, and it breaks its own literacy.

Knight Capital
--------------

Knight Capital should have been software literate.  It was a new
company, built to operate in the high-frequency trading world of US
equities, and had invested heavily in programmers and computers

Their business model was *market making* - buying shares from someone
who wanted to sell, waiting a bit, and selling them to someone who
wanted to buy. Market making is a valued part of all exchanges, and
way back, when the Exchange gave a priviledged few the right to be
market makers (for a fee of course) it was a very profitable exercise.
However as new market makers were granted access, such as Knight
Capital, the profits dropped (good for buyers and sellers, such as our
pension funds) and the competition sped up - slow market makers did
not get to trade with anyone.

On August 1, 2012, Knight Capital released a new version of their
software. And did so in a partly-manual manner.  Those words, 'not
automated' make those who are software literate shudder.  Imagine
having a book as a loose sheaf of papers, unbound.  You know its just
missing something.  Surely things will eventually get all muddled up.
And sure enough, at Knight Capital, they had left an old, debug
version of the code on one of their servers. Which now merrily started
placing *test* orders onto the *real* market.

Test orders, such as Buy high and Sell at a loss, and repeat 10,000
times in a few fractions of a second.

Knight Capital tried to turn off their mistakes, but 45 minutes later
(an eternity in HFT) they had mistakenly executed 4 million orders for
100+ stocks, and lost 440 million dollars, effectively bankrupting the
company.  Other players in the market had of course realised something
was wrong, and initially expected the orders to be turned off within
seconds. When it was not, they merrily took the winning side on all
Knight Capitals traded and pocketed the cash. No point turning down
free money is there?

Knight Capital's process of getting software that had been written
correctly out and into the hands of users (ie the equivalent of
publishing) was broken.  A newspaper that could write brilliant
articles but struggled with the whole delivering bundles to street
vendors would not last long.

In software, this publishing is called a release, but its as vital as
the process of publishing and delivering paper was to the Post.
Companies I have worked in have had ranges of automated releases done
a few times a day, or manually a few times a year.  Guess who felt
more ... literate.

It is worth noting that Knight Capital paid the full price for their
failure to control their literacy. However, this market imposed
discipline, which is societally a Good Thing, does not apply equally.
Goldman Sachs did a similar thing in 2016, sending broken orders.
Then instead of being forced to pay the price for their mistake, they
simply agreed with the exchange that those orders *did not count*,
reverted the changes and did not pay a billion for their own
education.

Thats simply wrong.  Remeber our nice fluffy liberal "everyone is
equal" values. That should apply to everyone.

Office Of Personnel Management
------------------------------

In June 2015, the US government agency "Office of Personnel
Management" announced it had suffered a data breach.  Starting in
March 2014, external hackers had breached the firewalls around the
agency and were able to access the personnel records of millions of
current and former government workers.  The agency collected many
things, like pay records, but also, held background checks on
employees who needed higher levels of security clearance - in short
they had the records that said you used to be a drug addict or
depressed. All the stuff they want to know about you in case it is
used to balckmail you.

This was it seems all stored on mainframes running COBOL.  And the
thing about storing data is that you must at minimum, encrypt it at
rest on disk.  This is like, using ink or folders or filing
cabinets. Its something you don't even think about.  Not for stuff
that foreign governments can use to blackmail your Embassy staff with.

So lets get this clear.  Vital security information and pay records,
stored unencrypted on mainframes that are so old they cannot spell
encryption, and then the Chinese hackers get in.

This breach, discovered seemingly by accident when a computer
forensics firm was asked to preapre a demo, is not something solvable
by replacing credit cards.  It is probably America's deepest national
security problem for the next few decades.  Well, one of them.

This is a defining moment in software professionalism.  The right move
for a professional and so the right move for a software literate
organisation, was to shutdown the impossible-to-secure mainframes and
announce a budget request and a migration plan.

Things like intrusion detection programs would have been good, but
thats just "normal best practise" not "professional ethics".

Now, why did the woman at the top (not likely a malicious actor) why
did she not take this action? Because of the degree of obfuscation?
Possibly. But the one thing that leaps out of OPM is the inabiliy to
enmcrypt on COBOL mainframes.

Perhasp Everything else is justifiable in the hindsight race.  But
when you simply cannot do the job ethics dictates you dont pretend and
carry on.

OPM shows us that one defining quality of software literacy will be
professional ethics. to quote Spiderman, "with great power comes great
responsibility".  For the next generation at least, software literacy
will be unevenly spread throughout the world.  And the importance of
software to the world at large is so great that we should ensure those
who wield that importance are not just expected to be trustworthy, but
are monitored by their peers.

Professional Ethics still matters

Sweden Ministry of Transport
----------------------------

So just as we thought OPM was bad, the Swedish Government stood up,
looked the US Feds in the eye and said, "Hold my beer"

https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2017/07/swedish-transport-agency-worst-known-governmental-leak-ever-is-slowly-coming-to-light/


Target and Yahoo
----------------

Target and Yahoo make interesting case studies. Target in 2014 had
given a Air conditioning contractor access *into* their internal
network, from the A/C contractor's own network.  So when the A/C
contractor was breached, the Target internal network was just a hop
away.

Target lost millions of credit card details, and, probably more
importantly lost their CEO because of the public reaction.

Yahoo, had attackers copy 1 Billion (image) email addresses and
passwords.  They only admitted it because they had to for SEC
rulings. (check)

Target is probably when software security failings first took a major
scalp.  Yahoo is probably the last.

Equifax
--------

Equifax is worse - waaaay worse because in this mucked up world of
mothers maidennname they alga every away all the answers. God knows
what the effect will be but unless the swedes shoot the manager and
Equifax goes out of business then we will never fix these security
issues


You want security in your company - fire the head of the CIA if he
can't keep his affairs secret. Fire people who breach
secrets. Otherwise stop worrying about it


Healthcare.gov
--------------

As part of Barack Obama's healthcare reforms (back pre-Trump, if you
can rememebr that far back) a government agency was tasked with
setting up a online exchange that would allow hundreds of millions of
Americans to search for and find the most suitable of the new
insurance contracts that were available.  The project was handled in
the usual manner, and as is usual for large software projects it
failed to achieve its goals.  THis was hugely embarrasing and
*actually meant a large scale political initiative was at risk because
software it depended on was badly written*. (THis in itself is a
seismic moment.)

So the while mess was put in the lap of one of the new Breed of
GOvernment Best-practise Digital Agency, who proceeded to rescue the
mess, using best practise appraches. (it was not an unalloyed success,
but it worked).  Famously the attitude used was boiled down to a quote
from a frustrated DevOps engineer, who during a fraught and well
populated project meeting asked "If I cannot deploy New Relic (a
systems monitoring system) I'm gonna punch somebody".

WHilst violence in the workplace is obbiously forbidden, the teams it
seems divided along the lines of people who thought it was obvious to
use these new tools, and thus obvvious that someone banned from using
them should get driven to rage, and those who thought it was obvious
to follow the old, way.

THis dividing line is what i think of as the software literate line.
The point at which one thinks "WTF?" when looking at processes or
services.  The point at which a literate person would look at a
company or society that, for example, has a legion of clergymen, who
stand up in chilly expensive cathedrals, and read out political
declarations.  And say, "Why not just print them and nail them to the
church door so people can just read it themselves?"

That is the dividing line.  That is the sort of change to society
softeware literacy threatens.


What have we learnt
-------------------

A software literate company will not necessarily have these issues
fixed and working perfectly, but they will be top of mind, and
everyone in the company will know, not "something is wrong" but "this
thing right here is not happening"

Look at the famous "New Relic Punch".  There was not "we do not know
what is going on" but a clear "if I do this I will know what is going
on".

OPM shows us the new scope of ethics, and Healthcare.gov shows us
"normal best pracise"


There is hope
-------------

Government Digital Services


However, these are not normal, or default, or even expected. They are
high profile and positive. But legal frameworks (from privacy laws to
the defintion of a company) have not changed.  We need to go further
in changing the structure of a company.

The rare, right way
-------------------

The failures above are all very varied. Amount them no obvious
solutions.  This is the point - we simply do not know what the
Washington post of often years Hence will look and behave like.  But
like the team at healthcare, we don't need to We need to follow "best
practise".  Sadly there is no written how to on that - it is more the
gross difference between a Washington post set up and run by a
literate editor and that setup and run by an illiterate - charlelemn

A Mea Culpa - from me and Uncle Bob
http://blog.paul-brian.com/2015/06/05/being-professional/

::

  Conclusion The trick to handling pressure is to avoid it when you can,
  and weather it when you can’t. You avoid it by managing commitments,
  following your disciplines, and keeping clean. You weather it by
  staying calm, communicating, following your disciplines, and getting
  help

So as we know what is wrong, it is useful to dive into why, and what
to do about it.  Uncle bob recommends managing pressure - and Inwoukd
like to suggest that professionalism is an API we present to our stake
holders - like "keeping a promise"

The APIs -

    source control
    Keeping it readable

    tech debt and tech assets - code and tests
    Debt and assets

    requirements lifecycle (PEP)
    Theory of the firm vs professionalism

    automated build and deployment (dogfood)
    Staying clean

    Documentation and Marketing
    Again a cost of independence in market place

    openness and reviews
    Non n

    Progress Not Perfection (YouTube clip)

    static and other analysis

    performance mgmt and measuring everything (and making reports on everything)

    Automatic project mgmt

    Risk management

    have fun, try new things, don't be afraid

    Requirements Lifecycle (PEPs)

Maintaining a distance, is anathema to Agile hugs.
But look at IR35 SDC - Supervised, Directed and Controlled.
(The theory of the firm, transaction costs, Fonald Coase and IR35. Why requirements management is and is not good for you)

Why is it a good idea
Why is it a bad idea
Is it in my ideal project?

Can I craft a set of ideals for my Open Source Project and how do they touch upon the wider world of professionalism and crafts-person-ship.

A multi layered API for software engineers.
I keep stuffing it up. I am a fairly good coder - and have survived almost 20 years as developer, CTO and consultant. So I occasionally get it right.

The three goals of software engineering
Reliability
Stability

As the joker says, "no one panics if everything is going according to plan"

Progress is the best - not having a joker in the pack

    It's the new pollution- it has enormous benefits to society and its productive capability (ie medical research) but like industrial pollution it has downside and we have not managed to cope with the downside in 150 years. The U.S. Democratic model seems to lead the world in dealing best with pollution (not worried about German vs US standards of chicken handling - look at Russian radiation handling or the Middle East approach to spills.

We're global remember.

When does data become proprietary
--------------------////////------


Google encrypts the referrer header

Why is that private not public?

European courts missing the point
https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-economist-radio-all-audio/id151230264?mt=2&i=361720969

Possible free trade battle
But the battle is over the wrong thing
Data is public - it just is on vastly larger scales than we realise (pea souper fallacy)

Not only that but free trade areas in data will be needed to avoid
Balkanisation of the Internet

It's not unavoidable - it should be a free vs unfree world
The new capitalism - free data

Private data is private, unless published
There was a huge backlash against this for the first and other amendments
See the uk government under fox / Pitt

But the principal has held well
And we need to refresh it - and redefine publish in light of pea souper

http://uk.businessinsider.com/jobs-that-are-quickly-disappearing-thanks-to-robots-2016-2?r=US&IR=T



Open vs closed not right
Oppressive vs liberating is closer

Public data about us can be oppressive, can be limiting
But finding the balance is key
And the default should be open just as default was open for amweica



Exporting democracy

Where does half the world look to for inspiration?
Western democracy or Chinese capitalism without representation?

Democracy is exported - nation to nation, generation to generation
We need to define the new society with new parameters

European democracy is under threat, even building a wall around Mexico

Who wants that ?

Solutions

- remove financial spikes through removing tax relief on loan interest
- allow the natural state of software literacy to be enshrined in the societies norms laws codes and markets
- what is the natural state of software literacy

- best example is open source:

Open
Totally open
Candour
Democracy ?
Meritocracy
Evidence led



The shape of companies and countries to come
--------------------------------------------

So my hypothesis is that software literacy is a real thing, that it
will create programmable companies, and that companies that have a
nervous system, that can be controlled with smaller numbers of humans
instead of having to have humans in place of automation, we shall see
smaller companies due to Ronald Coase theory of the firm

As such these smaller firms can negotiate better deals but what will
be the environment in which they do that

- free trade areas - a perfect market
- common market
- federal system

Discuss European referendum


What’s more, as software eats the world, one side effect is that rewards accrue nonlinearly to those with the best software


Politics and software
---------------------

One thing worth noting is that if he is right, and Facebook (and lesser extent Google and Twitter) represent the new gatekeeper / aggregator for political news, then there is a crying need for their algorithms to be public, and there is a whole industry of political SEO

https://stratechery.com/2016/the-voters-decide/


CIA and job protection
----------------------

America is 50x richer than the rest of the world, but
Let's face it, that's historical accident and some luck of
Democratic capitalism culture

Now the world is consensus - we all know democratic capitalism of some form is the way to go
So will the USA stay fifty times richer? No

Will they get poorer in absolute terms or just wait
in stagnation while everyone else catches up (pretty much what middle class wages have done relative to China)

Either way, USA is likely to fight - hence the CIA and the hegemonic back doors - the use of intelligence gathering against Brazilian companies.

It is Canute turning the tide back.  By throwing stones.

It's not going to be pretty

Redefining privacy
------------------

There is a new round of crypto-wars going on (see Obama speech "absolutist")
But this is part of wider discussion around meaning of privacy

It's a privative

It's based in secure in ones home - constitution

But let's look at ambient computing.
Intelligent context aware programming

Scenario: I walk from my kitchen to the living room, and the music I had playing dims in kitchen
And starts up in living room speakers.  I say "house! Something more dinner jazz please, and dim the lights"

Now to do this I must have computer monitoring me and my voice
It must stream music, electric usage will dip.


How can I defend my privacy?
Do I really care ?
Prevention of annoyance?
My music tastes probably say only a little politically
but what films I watch, what documentaries? Fox News or CNN ?


Social organisation and software
- software as it needs precision highlights a lot
For example conways law - social organisation of contributors reflects the software produced

http://hintjens.com/blog:112

More clearly is need for individual rights
This is a politically accepted thing in real world - but as we move to situation where whole world is a contributor what happens? Much more planning and modelling?


Productivity :

The second biggest issue of our time
Basically the low hanging fruit of mechanisation has gone.

Productivity as measure of energy used to output

The future is more complex solutions to drive smaller increments in productivity until energy becomes orders magnitude cheaper or our usage orders more sophisticated

This should be the big win for electronics

What we are missing is organisational change to cope with it.

Most organisations hold back productivity- and fixing that will be hard

- also remote working and competition across the globe

Privacy:

The biggest issue of our time
The modern day pollution
The issue is who sets the laws
The issue is we must be regulated (murder)
The issue is we shall see Google become a utility in need of regulation - but under whose jurisdiction?

How in Europe do we set this? How in USA? What about China (monitoring all )

Privacy shield - max schremms

Audio visual media services directive - tv regulation. Country of origin country of destination

Unregulated is impossible
Light regulation means skills and information to deal with

The less regulation, the more transparency and individual tools to compensate

My view: it is harmful to insist on country of destination style solutions to regulation as these allow dictatorships to censor

We should have global agreements on base regulation (child pornogrpahy, hate speech etc) and enforce transparency - and it is upto destinations to educate and provide tools to support their choices.

When Richard Feynman died in 1988, his chalkboard at CalTech contained
several notes, including the one that has struck such a cord with me

::

  What I cannot create I do not understand

This says *everything* I want to say about why Open Source Software is
important, why re-creating the existing work is important, why open-
and transparent-ness works, why things need to be evolved not designed
and why, we cannot understand everything.

It takes a genius to put all that in 8 words.

So, what can be extracted from eight words.

* Build from scratch
* Open Source keeps re-inventing the wheel
* software is evolved
* relax.

Build from scratch
------------------

One of my software development tenets is you should be able to *build
your whole systems from scratch*.  We start, of course, at the
bare-metal hardware level.  I truly do not understand manufacturing
billions of switches at 10 nm. But still, given metal hardware, get up
and running, not from a few lucky backups and _dd_ but from controlled
scripted installs.

I have always thought this vital - without being able to (re)create
your systems, how do you know if you can in a disaster, or more
importantly that you can when it is not a disaster.  ITs impossible to
believe that the first time you installed your webserver you got it
perfect, first time, but if you cannot rebuild it with confidence, you
just will put off rebuilding it again and again until it is a mess of
libraries, patches and symlinks that you could never hope to remmeberm
nor worse, simplifiy.  Now expand that to your DNS, file server, your
database.

But being able to run a simple script, and the system is configured,
that makes life so much simpler.  I can read the script and see what it
will do.  I can change it, experiment, confident that I can just rerun
the original and get back to where I started.  And I can run the script
and go do something more interesting.

And no, I do not believe in _dd_, _ghost_ or other image based
methods.  Yes, they are very nice for Virtualisation, but always there
is a flaw - to get to an image, one has to build the original.  If you
build the original by hand, how do you know what steps you took - how
sure can you be? The Sysadmin was very careful?  Was he? Thats nice.
Oh look a new patch is out, and we no longer want to use version 5.2.2
of php and can we put the incompatible library onto only half of the
hosts.  Can you rebuild all of the images to do that, by tomorrow?
Still going to be careful are you?


Build from scripts, from scratch.

And you know what, I finally worked out why I was so insistent on this,
in the face of others desire to take the easy route.  Quite simply because
I did not understand a system till I had wrestled it enough to automate it.

You find out where all the gaps are when you try and automate a system.


Re-inventing the wheel
----------------------
I am (re)writing a ER diagramming tool, for about the third time. This time no
funny copyright issues with my employers, I swear.

But there are many ER tools out there. And there are many languages, databases,
games and more.  This does not stop us from writing another, just as
the existence of a Haynes car manual does not stop people from taking their
car engine apart.  We do it because we do not understand, and we want to learn.

Sometimes, there is an itch to scratch.  But often the itch is for knowledge,
and the desire to know if we *can*.  Benefiting the rest of the world is what we
do to share our knowledge.


Evolution
---------

Because we have to re-invent the wheel to teach the next generation,
we tend to incrementally improve.  And that is a slow evolutionary process.

Software *evolves* to fit its niche.

Relax
-----

I am sometimes troubled by comparing myself to some of life's winners.  But
looking at Feynman makes those comparisons silly.  A genius that other genius'
thought a genius, he still tried to understand this strange world we live in,
and had no more a grasp on *why* than the rest of us poor schmucks.

So, we do what we can.  And move the world on a little bit.  Some more than
others, I must admit, but I am happy to be pushing it in the right direction.
==============================
Price of gold is fairly stable
==============================

------------------------------

I do love me a bit of Ancient Rome.  And I love the term Solid - it came from the solidus, a gold coin minted by Constantine 315AD

Domain have done some amateur digging and will try the following: in Neros day 2 denarii would buy a Modius, which was sufficent grain for ten days for one average male (two one pound loaves a day, there is a diet to make wheat intolerant weep)

Now the aureus was replaced by the solidus, but it was about 25 denarii.  So we can say that one gold coin bought you about 100 -120 days worth of basic food.

A kuggerand is about four times the weight of gold as a aureus, and it's about £1,000 to buy today. And at £3 per day I could carefully feed myself.  Certainly in bread alone.

So over nearly 2000 years, a gold coin is roughly enough to feed one man for three months.

Fascinating

The Journey of Mikado Software
==============================

==============================

The journey to freedom
----------------------

I was made redundant in 2008, from a nice CTO job in London's City, at the
height of the financial crisis.

Now, I have worked in the "Internet Industry" since 1995.  Yes I am that old.
And I have done most jobs, from CTO to consultant, Developer to DBA.  I ran some
of the UK's first ADSL trials back when 14.4 modem was a big deal, have written
software for the FTSE100 and the footie club.  And so I decided not to take
it lying down.

Two weeks later, I walked into a new contracting job, and I hustled, and hunted,
worked my way up the salary ladder, started my own consultancy and landed the
*big gig*.

It was the worst move I ever made.

I sat in a car for between 2 and 4 hours a day (and I never knew how long the
trip would be).  And I was not curing cancer so I could hardly claim my work was
worth the sacrifice.

.. figure:: /_static/m25.jpg

I saw my children only when they were asleep, or at weekends, when I was
exhausted. My wife saw me for about ten minutes before we climbed into bed and
slept shattered.  It put strains on my marriage and our kids.

And I put on nearly two stone.

So, as that contract ended, I swore to stop.  I did not need to actually be in an office, watched to see if I was slacking off.  I could work remotely, from
anywhere, for anyone.

And things turned a corner.  I was able to walk into
work, able to make breakfast for my kids, let my wife have a lie in and a cuppa.[#]_

It is not heaven, bills still need to be paid, relationships repaired, the office is tiny.

But like nearly 3 out of 4 workers, my job does not need to involve me
travelling to the same office as everyone else.  Nearly 75% of us could do the
same job from *anywhere*.  And we could do it minutes from our families, our
lives.

The more of us who make that break, who escape, the more our societies will
shift.  Till raising a family stops being a struggle that tears us from being
productive in work.


The journey for freedom
-----------------------

One of the defining characteristics of the next decade of the Internet is
the vast, vast amount of data that will be available, and the new insights
that data will afford us.  But it is too much data for any one company to
own it and use it.  All the pharamceutical companies will need to share their results to find the next break throughs, all the financial companies will need to
share their trades to avoid the next crash.

Data will have to be *open* to be *big* and with that will come the open software to handle the data, and the open forms of working (like above) that will
be used to write the software.

And this is my second journey - I am a `passionate believer
<http://www.oss4gov.org/manifesto>`_ in the role of open source in public sector
software.  Mikado Software is driven to put high quality, open software into
government and public sector hands.  We are not a lone voice, the new NHS Spine2 will be built on the open source Python language (a speciality of Mikado) and the Government Digital Service is not just revamping websites, but pushing the
very defintion of Open and Agile into the heart of UK government.

Journey's End
-------------

I care passionately about my family, which makes me not unique.  I also care
passionately that governments, councils and citizens all have the right to read
the software that more and more runs our lives.  The right to read it, critique
it, and one day remove the offending code.  Just as we do with our written laws
today.

Software matters now, and will matter more in the future.  It need to be kept
free and open so the laws that run our lives are as accessible as the laws that
govern us.

Mikado Software is the end of two journeys, a company that treats work that can
be done anywhere as an opportunity to work anywhere, and a company that creates
the future of public services.

Topless computing
=================

(June 2007)

Not nearly as much fun as it sounds
===================================

The other day I was asked by a member of staff if it would be possible to tie
the holiday spreadsheet into the master workplanner application.

Now *possible* is a horrible word for IT people, because it is *always*
possible.  Its really a question of is it a good idea.

I said, well, not until the holiday recording was taken out of spreadsheet form
and put into something that was less ... topless.

Yes, I got the eyebrow reaction.

However it does make sense.  We do not know what the future is going to hold, so
it is always sensible to put our data and code into a form that makes it easy /
simple / feasible to build another system on top of it.

In other words we should build our systems to be **top-less**.

Of course, like in the real world, there are varying degrees of topless.  A
spreadsheet is possible to extract data from.  Perhaps I could write a
Python-server that looked at Excel at one end and spat out HTML / JSON the
other. But then I need to map employeeIDs between excel and this other thing,
and write some interpreter for the weird way the spreadsheet deals with time,
and it would probably be a good idea to cache the dates for speed, which means a
storage engine, and by this time I have written yet another half-assed
application, that still does not handle half-days sick, nor talk to the payroll,
nor know anything about regulations.

But to get rid of it will mean *me* going off finding a list of decent payroll
applications, and asking if they are topless.

Which always makes for a fun phone call.


To me **topless computing** is really, truly **user-friendly** software.  But by
that I assume there are computer literate users being considered.  Because
user-friendly does not mean it has a nice UI, it does not mean it has predictive
text.  It means that when I want to extend it, it does not get in the way.
(Some describe this as difference between *plumbing* and *porcelain*).

If all users could write source code, all programs would be topless. Or at least
have easy to remove bikinis. [#]_ And that is ultimately why I go around talking
about topless computing.

Because it sounds naughty.

A point about Software Literacy
-------------------------------

* Software Literacy is an important concept - it is hard for us to
  recongise how literacy has shaped us and our society. Look at road
  signs. And it is hard to recognise how much software literacy will
  change companies, socieites and opportunities.  This is the
  underlying message of "Software is eating the world" - we have made
  a world that only works because everyone in it can read and write.
  We are making a new world, where everyone will be expected to code.

* Software is subject to politics, but the importance of software is
  leaving development of softre to be driven by people who do not
  "understand" software (see literacy), and it is also leading to
  substandard software being allowed.  Regulation and
  professinalisation is likely to affect that.

* Almost all software development is about exploring.  And two things
  we can say about exploration - you never know how long it is going
  to take and it often is risky.  Guess what the vast majority of
  project planning and management try and do They demand time
  estimates and plan other items around that, and they do not schedule
  resources to mitigate risk.  In my experience, software takes as
  long as it takes.  All the running around and shouting, the pressure
  and the politics are just ways of selling the inevitable time /
  money / scope trade offs.

* Software literate company The value of building good software as a

:focus: how size and structure of companies is determined and it ain't management cleverness. 


* organisation deterministic factors
- cognitive load of reasoning about the function of the organisation
This is huge - Boeing, Banks, government
It will imprave as programmable company
But it is the main cost

See coase - this is cost of external contracting vs internal contracting
That cost will change as employment rights change, as intrnet allwos simpler intergration (saas) and monitoring of SLOs 

See Developer hegemony -
The cost of employeing "contractors" changes as it becomes more sensble to simply leave.




Also: We must include political biases when "asking a software engineer to designing a company" - look at openness and transparency in project reporting or in open source code reviews etc

it is more efficient yes, but openness and transparency are a threat to established orders - only meritocracy survives (look at linux and even thorvaldsen being less of a git)

dictators know this - and what is a CEO but a dictoator in a top down ecology

So democracy in companies might not be a requirement for literacy, but like literacy in europe, it has one end point.

as such gov tech software is a genuine need for focus.

THere must be acoase minimum - how is that changing.
	
Why are companies the size and structure they are. why are some
companies more successful than others, seemingly able to take on more
challenges at faster speed?

these questions are the reason bookshops groan under the weight of hardback business books trying to sell the answers, but they also are deeply important questions for humans globally - the organisation, be it commercial company, government department or city hall is the umbrella of protection for almost all humans alive today - for legal protection, income and environment

  designing your processes for scale matters too
  

We can see Apple Run book / operations managemet as the earlu step in this world
But a completely what-if, flexible company will be anle to turn on a dime.

But this will come at costs - humans dont do well and need ther sort of explanation and mission and feed into decision making

Imagine everyone having their own engaged model of the company (ciuntry) and arging which is best format.  May never decide? or may just go with flow?


http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/employee.pdf
Excellent take on coase minimum 

So in modern world the process is thenthings - a single slip up causes horro - something a s project mange I know too well.  Approvals ...

And so what is needed is solutions to this - continuous integration is tried - but this is fixing things after they gone wrong - just really quickly after they go wrong

Apples vaunted process is to model the process correctly first

And this is my argument for the new company - the programmable company is one where all the interactions are programmed and viable in pre-production allowing choice, optimisationand modelling


The changes we are seeing about programmable company 
----------------------

https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/a16z/id842818711

- Everyone becomes an analyst
- everyone becomes a real time analyst
- we are seeing rise of software mediated marketing (growth hacker) and product management (where the product is reporting on metrics (ie funnel) and so guides next feature development

and 

- modelling of organisation will be means to management of org 

 
- you need software skills not easier tools
- you need application performance monitoring for business processes - internal and external (internal friction or monitoring our marketing response)

why software - because it is infinitely easier to get a programmer to analyse data from five areas and knock up a report than it is to wor it's a tool flexible enough for a non programmer

it's like can you write a tool to let annilliterate write a book? 

and so it becomes easier to hire coders and teach them to make good business decisions than hire business deciders and teach them to code

the last generation is at the top now

Why companies are not really command and control

Politics gets in the way.  At the point at which internal polirics (conpettion over resources)
starts haveing serious consequesnces is my view ofr the coase minimum


An interesting blog by google about manifesto

Idea was as got further on in career stopped doing the coding and
started doing the "what needs to be done and how" stuff

But this is precisely what a market is good at. 

Looking at my experience of large companies an awful lot of management
(risk and project) is just competing with other people to be first to
look viable and have a following - thisnis ridiculous Ina centrally
planned economy of a company - you may as well do it properly and have
a market place (tournament style promotions etc) especially as there
is less likelihood of Values conflicts

Of course not everyone Is an entrepreneur- everyone more likely to be
of their basic income is protected.


Also why airbucks.io is an example of project that works in
marketplace but notninside company

A point about Company Size
--------------------------

OK, this is meandering a bit but, company size matters. A mid-20C
econmist named Roald Coase had a great theory of the firm - basically
wondering why a firm would have say, an internal depratmetn for, I
dunno, say, market research, when it could go to the outside markte
and buy it in.  Why hire employees basically.  And the answer is its
easier to tell an employee what to do, and then change your mind as
circumstances change, than it is to find, source, and contract for
similar in open market.

A lot is changing about this.  From Virtual assisitants to others.

But downward sizer pressure exists.  (see note on Google / Barlcays)


Democracies as information systems 

- and how to use information systems to transform companies to democracies

Democracy is an information system.

That's the starting place of our new paper: "Common-Knowledge Attacks on Democracy." In it, we look at democracy through the lens of information security, trying to understand the current waves of Internet disinformation attacks. Specifically, we wanted to explain why the same disinformation campaigns that act as a stabilizing influence in Russia are destabilizing in the United States.

The answer revolves around the different ways autocracies and democracies work as information systems. We start by differentiating between two types of knowledge that societies use in their political systems. The first is common political knowledge, which is the body of information that people in a society broadly agree on. People agree on who the rulers are and what their claim to legitimacy is. People agree broadly on how their government works, even if they don't like it. In a democracy, people agree about how elections work: how districts are created and defined, how candidates are chosen, and that their votes count -- even if only roughly and imperfectly.

We contrast this with a very different form of knowledge that we call contested political knowledge, which is, broadly, things that people in society disagree about. Examples are easy to bring to mind: how much of a role the government should play in the economy, what the tax rules should be, what sorts of regulations are beneficial and what sorts are harmful, and so on.

This seems basic, but it gets interesting when we contrast both of these forms of knowledge across autocracies and democracies. These two forms of government have incompatible needs for common and contested political knowledge.

For example, democracies draw upon the disagreements within their population to solve problems. Different political groups have different ideas of how to govern, and those groups vie for political influence by persuading voters. There is also long-term uncertainty about who will be in charge and able to set policy goals. Ideally, this is the mechanism through which a polity can harness the diversity of perspectives of its members to better solve complex policy problems. When no-one knows who is going to be in charge after the next election, different parties and candidates will vie to persuade voters of the benefits of different policy proposals.

But in order for this to work, there needs to be common knowledge both of how government functions and how political leaders are chosen. There also needs to be common knowledge of who the political actors are, what they and their parties stand for, and how they clash with each other. Furthermore, this knowledge is decentralized across a wide variety of actors -- an essential element, since ordinary citizens play a significant role in political decision making.

Contrast this with an autocracy. There, common political knowledge about who is in charge over the long term and what their policy goals are is a basic condition of stability. Autocracies do not require common political knowledge about the efficacy and fairness of elections, and strive to maintain a monopoly on other forms of common political knowledge. They actively suppress common political knowledge about potential groupings within their society, their levels of popular support, and how they might form coalitions with each other. On the other hand, they benefit from contested political knowledge about nongovernmental groups and actors in society. If no one really knows which other political parties might form, what they might stand for, and what support they might get, that itself is a significant barrier to those parties ever forming.

This difference has important consequences for security. Authoritarian regimes are vulnerable to information attacks that challenge their monopoly on common political knowledge. They are vulnerable to outside information that demonstrates that the government is manipulating common political knowledge to their own benefit. And they are vulnerable to attacks that turn contested political knowledge -- uncertainty about potential adversaries of the ruling regime, their popular levels of support and their ability to form coalitions -- into common political knowledge. As such, they are vulnerable to tools that allow people to communicate and organize more easily, as well as tools that provide citizens with outside information and perspectives.

For example, before the first stirrings of the Arab Spring, the Tunisian government had extensive control over common knowledge. It required everyone to publicly support the regime, making it hard for citizens to know how many other people hated it, and it prevented potential anti-regime coalitions from organizing. However, it didn't pay attention in time to Facebook, which allowed citizens to talk more easily about how much they detested their rulers, and, when an initial incident sparked a protest, to rapidly organize mass demonstrations against the regime. The Arab Spring faltered in many countries, but it is no surprise that countries like Russia see the Internet openness agenda as a knife at their throats.

Democracies, in contrast, are vulnerable to information attacks that turn common political knowledge into contested political knowledge. If people disagree on the results of an election, or whether a census process is accurate, then democracy suffers. Similarly, if people lose any sense of what the other perspectives in society are, who is real and who is not real, then the debate and argument that democracy thrives on will be degraded. This is what seems to be Russia's aims in their information campaigns against the US: to weaken our collective trust in the institutions and systems that hold our country together. This is also the situation that writers like Adrien Chen and Peter Pomerantsev describe in today's Russia, where no one knows which parties or voices are genuine, and which are puppets of the regime, creating general paranoia and despair.

This difference explains how the same policy measure can increase the stability of one form of regime and decrease the stability of the other. We have already seen that open information flows have benefited democracies while at the same time threatening autocracies. In our language, they transform regime-supporting contested political knowledge into regime-undermining common political knowledge. And much more recently, we have seen other uses of the same information flows undermining democracies by turning regime-supported common political knowledge into regime-undermining contested political knowledge.

In other words, the same fake news techniques that benefit autocracies by making everyone unsure about political alternatives undermine democracies by making people question the common political systems that bind their society.


Fake news: being able to "win the narrative" in face of evidence - at scale, tailored to individual people at scale - usually as in Russia a negative de-engagement but if voting opportunity exists as in brexit it's a positive act (cf dominic cummings )


This framework not only helps us understand how different political systems are vulnerable and how they can be attacked, but also how to bolster security in democracies. First, we need to better defend the common political knowledge that democracies need to function. That is, we need to bolster public confidence in the institutions and systems that maintain a democracy. Second, we need to make it harder for outside political groups to cooperate with inside political groups and organize disinformation attacks, through measures like transparency in political funding and spending. And finally, we need to treat attacks on common political knowledge by insiders as being just as threatening as the same attacks by foreigners.

There's a lot more in the paper.

Good Citation practise

The panic began in April when a video that appears to show a child being scooped off the street by two men on a motorcycle went viral. The video was originally created in Pakistan as a public service announcement to teach parents to watch their children more closely. The end of the clip showed the child returned by the "kidnappers" who held up a sign: "It takes but a moment to snatch a child off the streets of Karachi."
But that wasn’t what millions of Indians saw on WhatsApp. In the doctored Indian version, that ending was cut off, so the child never reappears. (nytimes - https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/opinion/stranger-fear-children-kidnapping-india.html)

But if the video was embedded with hashed frames and linked back securely then it frankly is almost impossible to mistake that - it screams fake

Fraudulent Tactics on Amazon Marketplace

[2018.12.20] Fascinating article about the many ways Amazon Marketplace sellers sabotage each other and defraud customers. The opening example: framing a seller for false advertising by buying fake five-star reviews for their products.

Defacement: Sellers armed with the accounts of Amazon distributors (sometimes legitimately, sometimes through the black market) can make all manner of changes to a rival's listings, from changing images to altering text to reclassifying a product into an irrelevant category, like "sex toys."

Phony fires: Sellers will buy their rival's product, light it on fire, and post a picture to the reviews, claiming it exploded. Amazon is quick to suspend sellers for safety claims.

[...]

Over the following days, Harris came to realize that someone had been targeting him for almost a year, preparing an intricate trap. While he had trademarked his watch and registered his brand, Dead End Survival, with Amazon, Harris hadn't trademarked the name of his Amazon seller account, SharpSurvival. So the interloper did just that, submitting to the patent office as evidence that he owned the goods a photo taken from Harris' Amazon listings, including one of Harris' own hands lighting a fire using the clasp of his survival watch. The hijacker then took that trademark to Amazon and registered it, giving him the power to kick Harris off his own listings and commandeer his name.

[...]

There are more subtle methods of sabotage as well. Sellers will sometimes buy Google ads for their competitors for unrelated products -- say, a dog food ad linking to a shampoo listing -- so that Amazon's algorithm sees the rate of clicks converting to sales drop and automatically demotes their product.

What's also interesting is how Amazon is basically its own government -- with its own rules that its suppliers have no choice but to follow. And, of course, increasingly there is no option but to sell your stuff on Amazon.


The long grass of mediocrity theory of companies
----------------------------
A programmable company needs to exist because what you do not automate is going to revert to the mean - what you automate is a upwards ratchet


Roman Legonary theory of organisational management
-------------------------

Walk, don't run, but walk with big stick

legions walked in threes not very far but always defensible. 

The charge in movies and the slow profession in real life of attacking a castle

Capability theory - don't run, certainly don't sprint, but deliver and grow capability of team

software governance and social governance 
-----------------------
As facebook et al build tools for "governance" (combat bullying, view who views me we see those gov forms adapt to society 

Programmable company and bus factor
-----------------------------------

Bus factor is how many employees can get hit by a bus before company loses the institutional knowledge to continue

this has links to the director hazing - you have to be able to operate the levers even if the levers are dumbawful systems

but programmable company surfaces the institutional knowledge and encodes it - it may be more effort like an architect programming robot but once done it is explicit modellabke and open for A/B testing 

And so we see reduction in bus factor - in fact perhaps a bus factor of zero is needed

And this means most human creative work will be in finding and building companies that have product market fit - a coase dilemma perhaps - we can reduce the company size to zero ? 

Only antagonist parts are brand, changing market place, reliability of suppliers ? 

Let's look at the advantages of AWS over doing it ourselves. The guardian found that openstack was too much to do it alone. Mostly because the advantages of specialisation have accrued to Aws - they can afford to have someone whose a Kubernetes developer focusing on that solely ehwrreas guardian and even major banks can only have someone who knows how to use it

the size of core teams in even major banks is surprisingly small - and that means the firehouse hits you all - whereas even a little bit bigger means the firehoase can be avoided

which acrues a lot

Firehose metric for support growth
----------------------------------

you need at least one person removed from the fray to observe and OODA - lieutenants and above

Sergeants focus on the team lieutenants on the battle, generals on the war

but it only needs three levels max. and you can probably do without the generals

Growing Mary Poppins
====================

We are all familiar with the MOOC - massive open online courses - but, and this is it seems more part of *my* software mind than an obvious trend, I see a huge new space in the MOOP - massive open online psychology

We have phones alamo's glued to our selves, and many homes have one or more permanently listening microphones, such as Alexa or Siri, and with body-cams on the rise, permanent video surveillance in the home is not far off.


And I do not see this as a problem - in fact I see it as *potentially* ushering in a golden age.

So, a slight divergence over the the Khardasians.  This is a reality TV shows following the day to day lives of a family of (increasingly mega rich) California sisters.  I bring it up because when I watch it I am surprised by one thing - the degree of self reflection that is going on - in fact forced on the family.  For something like ten years, the members of the family have been asked by a director to sit down and talk to camera and answer questions like "three hours agonyour sister said she did not like the way you talked to her on Tuesday"

And when the family argues, they can discuss it whilst watching footage of the original argument. (expand?)

This degree of self reflection reminds me of Aristotle - the unexamined life is not worth living.

And soon we shall all be living lives like the Khardasians - no not californian luxury and private airplanes - but guided personal relationships.

It's perfectly within technology reach to monitor each and every conversation in my house - how many times a day I talk to my children, how my wife and I communicate.

Now monitor that, looking for common metrics, maybe AI patterns looking for high performing families, and enable me to review my day with the personal psychologist that siri becomes - 94% of happy people have conversations more "you" in it than you did just now

"is now a good time to pick that fight with your wife"

just look at use of text signals in depression (use of I)


Other reasons why MOOP
- Twitter and Facebook self monitoring (mword at bullion scale - see facebook CISO guy) is really hard and likely to be counter productive - we have taken every pub conversation, every snarled word, and made them searchable.

It is not pretty.  The world that used to be published is only "the best choicest curated" version of the world out there.

Yes by allowing global distribution it has given such ugly words more power 

But we cannot deny they exist - and if we want to fix them we need to deal with the words not suppress them (well there is a degree is suppression - you cannot walk up to someone and say "go home" because that's crap.)



Whatsapp / E2E privacy is good.  Just as video camera not cause vile people to film child abuse, they just filmed what evil crimes they were committing anyway

It's up to our society to find ways to discover such abuse (hands in photos etc)

The autonomous vehicle bizplan fallacy
------------------------------
There is a lot of interesting issues being thrown up around automous vehicles and it's worth diving into some of them because they throw the issues around software eating the world (the architects dilemma) into sharp relief

- The ethics "upfront" issue (cf governance) - hit the little girl or kill the driver?? impacts on global regulation. are you going to be able to drive a foreign car on this countries roads if the software is not patched?? 

- The "it's going to be cheaper"
Not until the death rate is close to railways at minimum.  Tesla is getting sued (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19802284) and claim that their safety is 3.7 times better than humans.  That's good and all.  but that's not the right comparison 

Roads kill an average of 43,000 people pa in USA. Rail has 7 passenger deaths (or a bit over 100 if you count workers and pedestrians at crossings)

So railways are the right comparison with self driving cars.  and railways are between 6,000 and 300 times safer.

If I get in a self driving car Inwant to be confident of not dying on a scale similar to trains or planes. 

We are a loong way from that

BAck when I was young I worked at Demon Internet and we would have *meaningful* discussions about how the Internet was going to change the world (in your twenties it is important to have strong opinions about how something you don't understand properly is going to change something else you don't understand properly.)

But one thing was clear - we were connecting the Virtual to the Real. And that made opportunities

But now that is *done* what next?

Well, firstly, of course it is not done.

The things still not online are ... our real day to day lives and our training ecesaary to be modern humans (see MOOPs)




What is about to make my life harder?
=====================================

Part of the challenge for a simple IT manager is to keep abreast of an ever changing landscape without falling into the twin tarpits of hype and cool.

No-one can be in this business for long without seeing the next big thing whizz past us like a dead bunny with a jetpack.  But inured as we maybe to the sort of hype that got me buying textbooks on marimba and push technology in '98, it takes many years to notice the plausibly disguised tarpits and not spotting them can waste time money and effort vanishing down dead ends.

Oh, by the way, as I am talking about future trends, I am officially sanctioned not to use the phrase 'paradigm shift', a crime for which the gulags beckon.

For IT managers there are four major changes coming

- Disks are becoming tapes
- Parallel programming
- Information security is as busted as DRM
- Everything else, probably involving privacy.

Disks are becoming tapes
------------------------

How big can a hard disk get?  I have got several 500GB disks, and can now buy 1TB disks, which considering I remember saving up for a 16*Kilobyte* expansion pack for my ZX80 [#]_ is quite terrifying.  However, the bods from Seagate believe that, just like light waves put a limit on how small a transistor can be photo-etched onto silicon, similar electro-magnetic theories limit the size of a 5 1/4" hard disk - but we shall reach 20TB before that becomes a manufacturing restraint.

Now for a randomly fragmented hard disk of 20TB the access time for any piece of data is quite slow compared to the total size of the disk.  This ratio has been increasing for a while, and it has some serious implications.

The amount of data a disk can output depends on 2 things, the *transfer rate* or how quickly it can pull data from under the head and out to the rest of the PC, and how quickly it can find the data on the disk. This last one is important.
Disks can now hold 1TB and will grow to 20TB. They can sustain transfer rates of about 50MegaBytes/s, but even high end disks take 5 milliseconds to find a particular location on the disk [#]_

Lets say we want to pull off mp3 files, snippets of conversation from my life. At a seek time of 5ms, I can get to 200 *locations* a second.  This is not the same as 200 files a second - it will be snippets of files, chunks that have to be pulled off and reassembled.  Today this does not matter much, but with a 20TB disk, and we choose a file fragment size of say 5KB that is retrieved each access, I have a throughput not of 50MB/s but 1MB/s.  That is 20TB / 1MB or 20 million seconds to retrieve the whole disk. That's 231 days by the way.

This is obviously a worst case style example, but if we continue to use hard disks as we have been in my career, then it will take that long to read a disk.  Obviously madness, so when we write to the disk we will have to think about the use of the the data later on.  Thats unheard of today.  Its back to magnetic tapes.

We will fill these disks. Not just with cute otters on youtube, but with our lives; emails, phone conversations, videos from our camera equiped eyeglasses (and if you think that is unlikely look at urban cyclists, there is a growth in cameras recording the daily commute ready to send in for that all important insurance claim against the driver who just hit you).  We shall go back to a time when the application developer had to think where on a tape the data was stored.

So disks will stop becoming random access and more than likely be time sequential storage.  Which is fine when I am looking for my phone conversation from the 22nd of August.  But it has a problem when I want all the phone calls I made to my wife, in which I mentioned taking the cats to the vets.  The implications for this are quite huge, programmers today live in a world of random access (this is one half of the reason for dominance of the relational database model).  To end that will require massive mindset changes, and we programmers are by and large a conservative lot.

Parallel programming
--------------------
With one massive change to the way programmers think already coming down the line, the next one is a doozie.

Moore's law is, for its kind, a famous dictum.  It basically states that the processing power of a chip doubles every 18mths.  Understanding this law is widely held to be one reason Microsoft defeated Lotus in the speadsheet market [#]_ - Bill Gates decided to go for the best new features even if it ran slowly, gambling that in time the chips would be twice as fast.  Lotus meantime tried to speed up their spreadsheet in the code, and the market chose the new features of Excel now running at acceptable speeds.

Moore's law has traditionally been implemented by chip manufacturers like Intel making transistors on silicon smaller each generation so squeezing more into a chip.

As mentioned earlier, the wavelength of light is making it difficult to do this any more, so chip manufacturers are basically cheating, keeping the size of the transistors the same but putting twice as many on there.  To get twice as many transistors to work really means two CPUs.  The problem with this is that a single CPU is in essence linear, one instruction at a time.  Programs were written with this in mind, and now,  what worked for Microsoft in the late eighties stops.  If I write my clever new, slow program, in 18 months it will still be just as slow  - it works in a linear fashion, is designed in a linear fashion and so will only run on one CPU.  That power doubling stops.

Intel have already announced a 32 core chip.  Now if I take the Lotus approach and optimise my slow code for multile CPUs, I will run my applications upto 32 times faster than the guy down the road.  I do not know what competitive advantage I can get from that, but it must exist.  In short, what worked for Bill Gates 20 years ago, seems to be stopping now.  There will be no free speed up in 18 mths.

There are new languages designed to handle these parallel programming worlds, they are a odd and hither too little trodden world of *functional programming*, with Lisp as the poster child.  However two new languages best represent the choices ahead - Erlang, which passes messages between nodes and essentially shares nothing between these cores, and Haskell which does something clever with shared memory which frankly I do not understand. And there in lies the rub, as these are new languages, new *paradigms* (there I said it), and they need massive shifts in how people think and work - and again programmers are slow to pick up new things.  Really new things that is.

Either way, to tackle the parallel programming world, programmers will need to learn a completely new class of languages. And look how long it took to go from C to C++ to Java, which basically was objects, then garbage collection. (about 30 years. Can we wait another 30?  Or perhaps there is competitive advantage in Erlang?)

Tarpits
-------
Here we can see tarpits forming, and it is worth commenting on their likely shape too.

There are already rumblings about Intel and others developing compilers that will parallelise your program for you, meaning the programmer does not have to think about the problems of running his app on 300 CPUs in different time zones, it just happenns. Yeah, and the crack Royal Air Force Porcine Display team is putting on a show at an airfield near you.  So much effort is being expended to stop us from having to learn a new thing.  That's not in line with the idea that computers are tools, not gadgets and we need to learn to use them.

Both the above lead to the much heralded Grid computing - we will treat computing like we treat electricity - ubiquitous and commoditised.

I just do not beleive it.

I can see how already commoditised services will be gridified - but lets face it the reason organisations use IT is two-fold: to not lose cost advantages from not doing what everyone else does (the move from letters and memos to email) and to gain competitive advantage by doing something better than others.

The first one will be gridified - if your email system works like everyone else's, you do not lose out.  But most of the driving force for new IT is to gain a competitive advantage - to be able to do what others cannot.  And that can, by definition, not be commodity.


Information security is as busted as DRM
----------------------------------------
I have an important database in the office, with lots of important data. If the competition finds this data we could lose sales, if the tax authorities find it we could lose the CFO, and if the press find it we could lose the CEO.  So it is important not to let anyone copy it, or take it out of the building.

That is suddenly not so easy anymore.  Mobile phones, PDAs, remote working, on the road, laptops and home offices all mean that the data needs to go to where the people are.  I can encrypt the data as it travels over the network, but the only way someone can work on it is if it is decrypted at their end.  This is the same as a DRM protected song can be as encrypted as you or EMI like, but at some point it needs to be played through my earphones.  At that point someone can copy it, both the songs and the tax data.  And lets face it if it can be copied and has a value, it *will* be copied. [#]_

There is an attempt to control this - Microsoft is trying the '''Trusted Computing''' approach - where the hardware is locked and prevented from running anything Microsoft (and by extension the IP owner) does not want run. However it has been a damp squid so far, and even Apple the most successful hardware-controlled-by-someone-not-the-owner approach is trying to persuade the music business to stop mucking around.
And what is failing in the consumer market will fail harder in the business market - the question to be framed is '''You want me to buy a laptop that can stop the MD from viewing his own sales data if Microsoft decides he is breaching copyright ? This being a man who cannot print from Word every other week?  Yeah, let me get my cheque-book.'''

My data is not secure when it leaves my little data-castle.  And yet everyone wants to work away from the office, on their iphone, in the park.

Privacy
-------
It is vanishing, or rather, the assumptions we used to have about privacy no longer match reality.  Most of my conversations were assumed to be private and *ephemeral* [#]_, and because they were between two or three people they were.  But when the conversations are on email, or recorded by someone's iphone or life-corder in their glasses, that stops.  Am I to be held to my every whittered word (even the ones on this site I would be happy to stay a bit more ephemeral.)

Conclusion
----------
Hype and the Next Big Thing are always around us, and spotting the difference between real faultlines and over-hyped faultlines is a difficulty, but one we must all learn.  The business world (and real world too) do not change that fast, the signs are all around if we care to look.  Like someone said, 'the future is already here, just not evenly distributed yet.'

that's not the argument the article was making - they note that tech and media (the fastest growing sectors, which not coincidentally employ most intensively IT workers) are just 5% of economy.

the argument is that when the rest of the economy employs IT at the same level of intensity, the remaining 95% will have similar productivity growth and hence see gains of wealth creation.

we then have to work out how to distribute those gains (hopefully fairly and equitably)

There is a oft quoted parallel with electricity replacing steam in factories- it took a generation or more for factories to stop being clustered around one large steam engine, running each corner of the factory to the speed of one central spindle.  the idea is that eventually companies will adapt to use "Digital" rather than adapting digital to fit them.=======================================
Serverless - not another paradigm shift
=======================================

According to Bill Bryson in his remarkable "A Short History of nearly
Everything", renowned Paleontologist Simon Conway-Morris was
cataloging the incredible diversity of body-types that had appeared in
an evolutionary instant during the Pre-Cambrian Explosion 500 million
years ago. Dozens of bizzare new body types (lets put claws on the end
of a nose, that might work!). Morris reportedly opened a drawer of
previously un-categorized fossils and remarked "Not another fucking
phylum".

This is a little how I feel with computing platforms and approaches in
our new century. A phylum you may have heard of is `serverless
computing`.

Its worth taking a moment on this one - it is going to be a tough
sell, but, like `AR`, I think its where the smart money will play.
And unlike AR, its not a new green field. This one requires us to
re-write a lot of enterprise code.  So it needs to offer some
advantages.

My evolution ...

Serverless computing is ... hard to explain. Let's imagine you write a
function that takes an HTTP request with a key "name" and your
function returns "hello <name>".  In the normal server-based world I
would know which server that would run on - I would have to worry if
it should run there or elsewhere.

Serverless simply has a scheduler that pushes the request and my
function to *any* server in a vast array


Issues
* security. You thought it was bad sharing a
* the solution here is run your own farm of machines. But that is expensive.
  


Serverless and functional. THis seems to be the winning combination.


Simon Wardley (we have already met him on business strategy) was
involved in an early serverless



https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-fuss-serverless-simon-wardley

It's another shift - findev 

It's basically event driven functions, or batch run functions.
But the concept is w don't want to worry about a server before we want to run the function.

The biggest concern is security 
The second biggest is where do I put my data


https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-auth-reference-app/issues/5


Hardware and software
----------------------

Trust is biggest issue

then using hardware and software - there is more value in both and much rarer

The second wave 
We are now seeing less of the "applied to everyone" startups looking for recruits and many more of the "specific niche that is ripe for software to eat it" start ups.

insurance for gig econmony (insurance by the minute)  legal NLP


Add in "the rental economy" (or the subscription economy) where the whole idea is to gain market domaince and then exploit prices sounds bad for us all - and we don't think regulation  is going to keep up (Europe) or be allowed to think about keeping up (rest of world) - see schneier on lawyers like us - https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/06/bruce-schneier-its-time-for-technologists-to-become-lawmakers/

Add on to this the ways we are trying to regulate the new tech landscape - GDPR, elizabeth warrens proposal to split up companies into platforms and exploiters, these are all generally good (software socialist remember) where good means having a floor but no ceiling to society.

Software as a machine 
---------------------

It is just a machine (transistors)
software as a machine - Paul Mason book - transforms energy into other form energy - so is it organisation as energy ?? better forms of working together - where is the utility? it's in the organisation !!!  

We need ethics in our society - we can see the market as a slow form of AI using price as the optimising metric

As such we can easily see from experience that market does not drive the higher ethical issues - they must be the externally regulated systems
- and for most people and indeed maoist capuchin monkeys ethics are the same (fairness and grapes)

see Paul Mason book 

As such I posit that we cannot make AInlook human till we have strong ethical constraints on it, which require ethical judgements 
(ie General AI is a long way off)

but we can see AI as helping optimise organisations (ie MOOP becomes a training device for the cog wheels) and organisational design and information flow becomes viable - i mean if brexit or trump can send different tailored messages why cannot the good guys (see I robot last book) 

Ethics are boundary conditions for optimising algorithm - same as regulation for markets - which is why regulations are so hard to agree on

Landscape and strategy
======================


https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec#.9hem3u240

The landscape, climate and doctrine from sun-tau determine strategy and the ins and out Avery well

Doctrine - like a style guide or dev manual for developers

But the landscape of software is often seen as magic by the ore-literate
And it's why algorithms matter



So it's the two kinds of why - why this move instead of all the other moves possible. That means you need an understanding of all the possible moves and their future implications - why means a map.

Swardley evolution as a Wodehouse approach to building viable software - it cannot be perfect out the gate and this gives is a value based evolution for the service (soa microservice api approach)


https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9145197

Simple to complex roadmaps
==========================


Swardley??

One of the important things in software, perhaps the most important, is to keep things simple.
As the needs of an organisation grow, the complexity of the systems it uses increases.
I show here, in each section, a roadmap of complexity.  The base simplicity levels are
expected to give the fundamental understanding of the problems, but give way fgracefully to
new, (ope source) solutions that do the same thing as the simple system, but have extra more useful features.

FOr example, in configuration and co-ordination, we start with just a init file style API that reads from a text file
telling us what config data exists for our systems.  This is *fine* but it really quickly hits limits.
SOmething like APache Zookeeper is the next logical step, but that is waay more complicated to set up.
So we start witht he simplest possible, and point to where to take the next steps.

This gives us some ideas of hot tomimplement to strategic landscape we see



The economist Robert Solow once quipped that we see the benefits of
computers everywhere, at home, at work, except in the productivity
statistics.  It has been argued
(https://eml.berkeley.edu/~bhhall/e124/David90_dynamo.pdf) that this
is because we are missing the essential rearrangement

Two productivity arguments - we aren't inventing stuff or we don't
have demand side drivers in western world - that is we can outsource
to cheap labour (Foxconn and Apple make iPhones) If we see 70s then
people invested massively as labour price was skyrocketing - similar
to post world war 1 (immigration, death etc)

Only when we absorb all human capacity to modern levels or social
changes

I think this is right - but it needs a little deeper
explanation. Let's look at architects, project managers and
bricklayers

Also internet not changed as much as washing machine - we see the big
communications changes in telegraph. Internet is changing the consumer
(the out of work ways we spend our time)

But it is still hard to see it transforming the in work hours.  Web
technologies do appear everywhere - but this is a function of more
robots ready to build houses - if only the instruction were there.



We only need project managers because the architects were not precise
enough. So the replacement of the bricklayer will soon become the
replacemt of project manager - the great hollowing out.

But this cannot happen if a business is still the equivalent of a
blueprint - needing builders and somon to actually make it work.

Only a programmable company, can be designed like an architect designs
a building - and only at that point can we look at theory of firm. At
things trading on our behalf, at companies that can be formed - is
this insane? Maybe but that's never meant wrong.


I did have the whole internet printing press thing going.  But we need
to look deeper

Software is not seeing the productivity gains it should.  But why?

Firstly we are not software literate as companies Not seeing right
size nor right interfaces

Second we are of seeing marketplace of companies to enable right
sizing But we can define what it is - code as the definition of all


Productivity gains held back by company structure, lack of code at all
levels

Architecture paradox - what we see as companies are not all the
decisions and functions needed - we are not seeing
everything. Software literate company will raise to level of explicit
code eachnof those activities - it will be real architecture to build.

A programmable company is one where all its activities and decisions
are encoded. See Apple and its runbook.  When asking for a quote ""


What is a programmable company - where it's decision processes are
both encoded, and adjustable by internal (direct coding) and external
(customers choosing or not choosing to buy, take action)

As much of facebooks actions, it's resource allocation, are steered by
the mass actions of its user base. It is a vast AB test. Now inntheory
this is true of any company - if we stop buying diesel cars GM will
stop making them. But the feedback is so crude and so long term that
it has little effect.  But the programmable company has much finer
grained touch points and is more attuned to them. More ML means even
more attundedness


So programmable company has all of its activities and its decision
points in code (migration to infrastructure as code) and these nodes
are programmable by internal and external actions.  This assumes more
democracy in the internal decisions (explicitly excluding people is
harder. See the linux hierarchy ? Open discussion, Chinese parliament)

With more activity automated we will see both more effi envy and more
problems - serverless world is where companies have to rebuild their
factories to accommodate software, the grain of the internet

Amazon had to solve these internally and basically released it.

Putting everything into code is the only way forward - from routing to
deliveries to accounts the whole skeleton of companies will need to be
as defined by code as an AWS web server.

We are going to redesign that much


Architecture paradox But this leads to the architecture paradox - by
having a robot do the building there is a lot more upfront work
fromthe architect (coding)

Productivity conjecture
- we are missing the re-arrangement of work - that software literacy may be 

I reject utterly that now that every freaking adult on the planet can
communicate with every other that we are not seeing productivity gains
(mobile phone choosing best market for produce)

- biggest idea is the iPhone. We just are not seeing the productivity
  gains we expect forom the Internet. It is hard to credit that it is
  a bubble the whole world has bought. We are nearly at a stage where
  every adult human has online access of some form.  That matters
  deeply

What we are missing is the re-organisation of the factory similar to that of electrification

We are missing the dynamo. 


Kaizen vs Kaikaku
-----------------

Run the company vs change the company

Incremental change (AB testing) vs Radical change

WHy not SaaS
------------

BEcause I *should* be able to do:

::

   authenticate('mycompany')
   for employee in get_all_my_employees():
       if employee.isTimesheetComplete:
           approve_payroll(employee)
	   send_payment_to_bank(employee)
	   send_email_to_employee(employee, template="youarepaid")

Now, there is a lot of noise about IFTT and all the SaaS providers and
so on but - they are wrong.

The above is the *right* way.

It just is.  You know it is.


Operations
----------
Severity Levels
usually maps to customer impact

(Apologies to Abraham Lincoln)

* All of the people cannot use all of it, all of the time
* All of the people cannot use some of it, all of the time
* Some of the people cannot use all of it
* Some of the people cannot use some of it
* Some of our capacity or redundnacy is lost, but no people are affected
* Everything Else

Is like a DefCon - actual *action* is required and defined and taken
(ie customer support portal is updated, these people are notified.)

This is *still* a programmable company - only we did not programm it
to deal with this situation and so it needs to be worked *on* not *in*


Politics and software
----------------------

- new economics becoming clearer - the neo-liberal consensus seems agonisingly wrong in Africa and just misguided post 2008
Open source - oss4gov manifesto



I argue that we are seeing three trends coming together

- coaseian ideal firm size is shrinking. Look at Bank of America/google.  Challenger banks etc. Yes vast scale matters - but at a certain point all business transactions are entries in a shared ledger. Remind you of something.


I don't think we are there yet. Ledger technologies don't scale to the level we care about punlically. But internally we are there.  But so was email before internet - the big win for electrification was the dynamo. 

- faster feedback on customer likes - wants in tech firms. Killing lions, cutting through beiraicy (end of project managers) 
- most projects are co-ordination - but code is self co-ordinating - programmable company is a non-project company

A programmable company is one where the current decisions are encoded in software

So let's imagine we take a decision on a project - this must mean a chnage to something (else it's a rubbish decision) so we record 

- what was decided
- why it was decided
- how to judge its success

This is a series of commits / changes across the base - from change to monitoring system to commits on the codebase 


Summary

If you are not coding, start
If you are not replacing whole projects with code that checks if other code is doing what it's supposed to, do that
If you are not migrating to a serverless, run anywhere model (with server-led for some highly optimised areas) do that
If you are not using crypto-signed ledgers everywheee internally do that
If your companies actions, reactions and decisions are not in code, do that
If you cannot do what if analysis on your company's defining code, do that




Steam factories and the rise of electricity
Steam factories ran to a central Rythmn, a single shaft ran from the vast engine across the factory floor and cranks attached to it. Everyone worked to the engines ryhtmn, physically located along the shaft

Toyota quality cicrcle simply could not be invented.



Culture 
Ok it's not the dog whistle version here - genuinely

Discuss economic changes (ha join Chang) - the reworking of world economic theory from neon liberalism after 2008. It is highly likely to undergo changes in western world

Now the software that is written is ireducably connected to culture it came from- the liberal hippy anti government culture of Berkeley has had enourmous impact (beards and gpls)
What is impact of Indian and Chinese culture - hard to say from outside. Some ideas are possible - less regexs, 

But open gov is almost a democractod imperative
I push Oss4gov but I need it funded by right wing maniacs


Steven Soderburgh shots his films on iphones - he does camera and editing "two more conversations Indont need to have"

It's this speed of decision making and reduction in friction that programmable company aims to produce - but it runs up against bad decision making of start ups in ethics feee regulation free environment 

OSS funded by EU

Facebook and radio lab podcast
expand a lot
Centralising has lead to trying to moderate at billion people scale - this leads to facebook moderation currently at 16,000 people looking at a million flagged items a day

the trade off between better (western cultural) norms (!) and raising the floor and being able to deal with granularity 

It most reminds me of the rowntrees model village - where they tried to make perfect community
Which is nice but it did not work for everyone and it chafed a lot and eventually people moved out because they wanted different freedoms - 

walled garden is nice but if you cannot build on the garden and create your own house and community then ... you will eventually outgrow it

Problems with PageRank
----------------------

Facebook and youtube etc are aggregators - and a problem with Pagerank leads to a global feedback loop - that google (the essential search engine) assumes that a *domain* that has high quality in one location has high quality across the board.

So facebook.com/newyorktimes is seen as good content by google.  And then facebook.com/grotmoron gets that same level of google juice.

This means that if you want your web page to be found by google it is waaaay better to put it on facebook than on your own domain

this leads to positive feedback loop for aggregators and a negative one for the domain based internet (which is how it is designed)

but this is a flawed google (search engine) view - in other words facebook is assumed to be guaranteeing quality of all its content - which effectively makes it a publisher (the big radiolab discussion on moderation at scale)

so some form of regulation for search engine seems sensible - ie something in robots.txt that tells you the site structure and site governance (ie this bit we publish, this bit is platform


Software Socialist
------------------

We live in utopian socialist society
VC funding is just ensuring nice middle class life not threatens when trying to build company

But point of (most) companies is not wealth creation (!) - Facebook just took ad revenue from Fifth Avenue
Amazon just moves sales from Walmart to amazon

But the organisational changes needed to achieve this are profound and deep - building amazon was an amazing acheieneltnt - and it is in the organisational format that government follows - government invests stem for long term wealth creation (new forms tech) and business takes that invention and innovates new product forms and new organisational forms to distribute the created wealth (or rather wealth only creates when it is distributed)

As such my predilection got expenreinifn with governance forms in organisations - why Debian is a bigger idea than its distbuttion


social media - it turns out that social media was actually public publishing - (Zuckerbetgs pivot to person to person messaging) - and that newspapers were curators of publishing - journalism was about deciding what gets putinot oublic sphere.  

democratic journalism is important - social media was a way of allowing people to publish something important  (mexico drug wars) or crap (influencers) - somehow we need good ways to find facts and raise them to consciousness - a backlog of issues and a store of facts


The new socialism - of the character
---------------------
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19661601

Companies will chnage to be more open because the benefits of the MOOP

Look at graduates of today - well adjusted renaissance people with little desire / experience to kill maim.

Was this how we imagined the future in 1800? No - yet we are what changed more than the world - we could not take the 1750 mindset into a car / modern world - it's not a question  of technical skills - it's about character and attitude 

it's basically why putin cannot take his country further - it's the reason the drunk cannot crawl out of the bottle.

It's about choice. 

Keanau would know 



Science funding and support
----------------------------

Are we seeing drop off in support for science and technology? Well, poets don't tend to compose eulogies for scientists buried in st. paul's very much like Newton? (maybe hawking?)

We are seeing explanation exponent change

what makes rocket ships go up - funding makes rockets go up - no bucks no buck rogers.

Funding comes from support - which comes from understanding why the next step counts - this is education

I am doing important experiments for kids and Inam 500 years behind !!

education funding comes first 

Statistical socialist
---------------------
I am a statistical socialist - i believe that every human being born in the planet is born within a narrow normal distribution for all of their attributes - intelligence, height, weight, good looks and sexual size (!) - and where their life outcomes are greater than the range of their distribution i believe those outcomes are influenced more by structural and systemic factors, and then by their character 


Rise (return) of curation
--------------------------
Death of the newsfeed 
https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/4/2/the-death-of-the-newsfeed
Newsfeed is going as facebook signals peer to peer focus (snapshot stories taking their toll)
But this implies rise again of journalism - who do i follow which leads to newspapers with opinions - but at least they are open accountable opinions (cf murdoch scandals) 

Position on platform vs search vs responsibility

It's going to be around picking out sample bias really really well

Seems to me to create multiple models using random selections of same training sets and then see if models come up with similar answers - can build statistical models around that.

find a statistician??? 

Predistribution
---------------

Roberto Unger - changing the market structure of it is unfair so that redistribution is not always swimming up stream

"A billionaire is an example of market failure" (me)

Progressive politics seems to be engaged in harm reduction for their opponents 

Brexit
------
The big takeaway here is the constraining of executive powers on international scene - Uvettee cooper oliver lwtwin bill - seen in congress refusing to ratify treaties with dubbya - this is greater recognition of gloablisation - not just trade between boundaries but with services and regulation a merging and porous nature of boundaries  - and a search for legislative approval - a search for democratic approval against executive power - truly reflecting the new power balance infra companies

The Big Ideas
-------------
We have well tested ways of using science to discover facts

we have ways of using engineering science to discover facts about machines

we are starting to use those lessons to run software system
then we shall use same engineering and statistical principles to find facts on the rest of the pyroamid - how to better run organisations 
and then societies

and we shall do so if we choose the right metrics to be guided by

and see david kings handling of foot and mouth - two days and it turned around by using what epidemiologist saw as simple 









A point about Pikety
--------------------

* Pikety redux

  - Labour lost, capital won (the reaosn wages not  subject to suply demand)
  - the great hollowing out
  - literacy and automation
  - Snowden was also right - data and pollution 
  - snowden

- Whats happening in the world - a sense of perspective

* also want, wars, trade, shipping, energy, employment, poverty, investment etc.* 
some kind of model / mapp for the whole world. where is the money flowing / going?


  That the record of software coming in to disrupt industry is good -
  it's hard to learn software.  As a company this book is about having
  software in your company DNA

A point about project management and democratic companies
---------------------------------------------------------

I am going to stick my neck out and go for it - companies will become
more democratic - we shall see more voting and consensus in the
workplace.  We will also see the end of deadlines as companies become
*event driven* - that is, instead of shouting "get to this point"
there will be more "we need to get here" and monitoring and
encouragement.


The problem is *always* at the top
----------------------------------

Most technical problems can be solved by changing the business environment.
If the security of a company is challenged because a top level executive refuses to follow
the security restrictions, then there is a clear choice betwene firing the Sales Director
or having security.  Only the Board can decide that, and once they do it must be clear.

Google is currently experiencing a similar issue over sexual harrassment.

Data publication




Fractal Management
------------------

How individuals and teams need to model, monitor, mentor.


- CI and repeatability
- reporting on functionality of running processes
- analysis of inputs, running, outputs
- reporting upwards and outwards
- marketing your code





security (secrets management & auth)
------------------------------------
-- user management / aithentication authorisation
-- FIDO


security (deployment / repeatability)
-------------------------------------


prod parallel
-------------
Modelling



-- plumbing







   


A point about Simplicity
========================


Our golden goal is to keep things simple.

Simple breaks in simple ways, simple is simple to extend and improve.

Its not that simple is *easy* - often it is the opposite of easy, or quick.

But simple wins out over time. Simple gives great ROI.

I throughly recommend listening to Rich Hickey on this subject (Link)

So please keep in mind - we aim for simple.  Even if our day to day
work pushes us to quick and easy and complicated.  We need to push
back.


Data Mangement  Philosophy
==========================

Data Publishing needs to be a business level function, providing
consistent accurate and timely data to the rest of the organisation is
a vital task.

Like Bezos, can only consume data that is published - and people only
publishbsokething they willing to support

"but i cannot get my job done if "... that's not the problem ... the
problem is clean data

it's like security - it's a priority or it is not.








.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] The linked essay is by Eric S Raymond and is almost two
   decades old, and lays out an important philosophical difference
   between how open source software gets developed (in a mad press of new
   things being tried out) and how cathedrals are built.  The cathedral
   builders have tried to learn from the bazaar, and concepts like Agile
   are helping (a bit) but building software in our modern day
   institutions is still frustrating.  As software eats the world, it
   will find politics and push back.
