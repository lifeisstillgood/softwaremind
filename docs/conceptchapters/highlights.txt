Structure
---------

* Intro

* Second Order consequences.
** coders are the new managers

** Slow death of management class
   - Shit jobs theory (paying off middle class / UBI)
   - administration and co-ordination simple replacmeent

** programmable company
- if it is possible to program the whole thing (think api access person.filter)
then managing it *must* be coding. Anything else is hilariously inefficient
- so only coders are managers
- so the barrier to being a manager is literacy
- so it will look like newspaepr office.  Editors discuss the stories.
- but the complexity level is huge (see microservices) and will need data analysis
- so the possible moves will be huge - but like proteins it is a manageable solutuion
- mapping as a means to discuss impacts
- internal journlism
- democracy unleashed by jounrlaism pointing out silly things.  But investors will support journalists on the big stories.
- companies already thoeretically seperated into changing the company and running the company, but this may well become clearer distinction.  Amazon warehouse staff vs coders.

* Democracy matters
History of industrial revolution, not just democracy.

chinas totalitarian bet conjecture: ML models of society will work
better than ee expcet - and this will affect organisations and
politics

But if we bet on democracy for our politics, our defence.
Why are we not betting on it for 50% of our resource allocation.
Are CEOs genetically superior to the rest of us?

massive advatnage of co-ordinated arms (which is why large companies work well - for now!)
but co-ordinated is hard and requires communication and awareness. internal jounrlaism 

* corruption, corrusion and software
A programmable company is a *transaprent and visible* company.
THis will obviously hit problems.  Spy organisations will have to adapt to this as well
Bribery will adapt in other ways. (not the McWiter brothers rolodexes)

* Software, Bots and personal lives

just having a server makes a diff
Bots and programmability - this will make enourmkous diff 
ApI ans rate likiting and so on 

we will get used to it - cotrage industries 



Scene setting
-------------

scenes:

silicon revolution: 
humans and computers making "centaurs" better together
Communication for every adult on planet

End of the mass market / long tail.
This will affect democracy (which scene: just selling packages of policies)

policy packaging
- individual political advertising - actuakky not a terrible idea - still needs regukatuin and of course a fully open model (see tubes wayer economics model)

What is ML good at and what is it bad at
- same thing as human expertese.

- need immediate feedback loops. Why market making in houses is hard and slow and shares is wrapped up.

so find one - what can younootimise for? 

- feedback
- non random features / calid encironemt / lots of opportinities
- timely feedback 
- deliberate practise

* Conclusion
Software literacy is a thing.
It will change companies and societies
A programmable commpany will operate at speeds undreant of.
But it will be like Jet fighter - building the company that is bigger and faster will
be a nightmare - but once it is done you can build many many more and cheaeper levels.
Once the trains are built and monitored then it just runs.

However we should expect accurate costs.  This might mean a degredation of expectation in society

Democracy is a thing too.
Democracy thrived and needed mass literacy. So people could learn and trust
The new democracies will need mass software literacy - same learning and trusting

"A programmable company is what you get when you ask a software engineer to design
a company."

It wont look like anything else we are used to.

Hints
- microservices, swarms, AB testing, requirements and capabilities.


Introduction
------------

say-what-you-are-going-to-say

Cavern introduction
Cabinet office

The explosion of software literacy.

- software is a new form of literacy

This book is based on a (reasonable) conjecture - that software is
best viewed as a new form of literacy.

This is ok - we can see the suprficial similarities - but its the
downstream impacts that are the most interesting, and more controversial.

software literacy, comouter science and electronic engineering

the hard stuff is between compteru dcience (algorithms, languages compilers) and EE (something forbthen to runnon)

this is not software literaxy intue main.
expressing a flow in software is not same as building an socillscope from parts 




why is tech disrupting (appleninto banks, new banks in uk, amazon into groceries, google into x)
because the advatnages of software kiteracy are so great


 * Democracy again

look at Modern monetary theory - gov is just partnof whole economy

so why is the resource allocation of gov under (rheoretical) democratic contorl but the allocation of private capital not? why is private capital not under control of the demos? it is partly as regukations and trqdition 

but why / why not have those in the edge make the allocation decisions ? 


conjecture:
ML models of society will work better than ee expcet - and this will affect organisations and politics 
We could bot do inage classification because we did not have millions of labelled images of cats and 
not enough comouting power

The problem of aociwty / polirics is loved experience - and as we captire (surveill) more of it we will have more reliabke data fir --- Seldonism ??

But what are the scores / feedback loop? Constant polling? ideology is simpler ... dangerous 



Open democracies will have an advantage in that free soeech in johrnalism is a labelling probkem

that ckass docides and elites will have to decide what to do - triumph of the socialst

Privacy social media and AI

Democracy and companies
-----------------------
Glassdoor has a paradox at its heart. Yes we all want to have honest reviews of corporate culture, and anonymity is probably the only way to get that. Except that how does anyone trust an anonymous post ?
The only way to get around this is some impossible to imagine global regulatory chnage where companies may never take action against negative non-anonymous postings.
I am not sure how to overcome this massive information asymmetry that corporations have against us

the issue is if i stand up ans say "this strategy is crap" basically I lose my job.  But if we vote then a lot of issue get chnaged. 

The democratci company conjecture
---------
We westerners have satisified view that democracy has advantages inherent 
- i agree (chinese totalitarian bet) but if so then there are advantages for democracti xompnaies

- free flow of information - just discovering any source if data is hard ket alone "whats being planned" 

conjetire: a journkistic arm for conpanies will procode major benefits (and unleash horror)

organisations, humans, tribes, politics, democracy

double down on democracy - is not the same as double down on the Status Quo
Democracy is a means to ensure change in sufficinet time
THe old argument of strong man needed is an fallacy - because there has not (yet) been an example of a string man taking over from a demoacracy - they all appear better than periods f stagnation.

Bad investment decisions
-----------------------
Most VCs aee holding back hige funds in fear.

But what they should fear is bad business invesmtn decisions - see would Ininvest in columbis 

(take a chance on fusion - send asanta Maria)

But crypto like bitcoin and uber and airbnb are somobviously bad ideas

I relate this to urban design.  Feankly good urban designnis simple - less cars mostly (strong towns, walkable city etc) 

but none of this is profitable ajd spectactular and big shiny orojects

And same goes for software. What we want are simple open things. things that are vakuabke but public. No one gets rich owning central park.

Software is like loteracy. its not something that is valuabke if you keep it tonyiurself . 



Software Literacy and Second-order consequences
===============================================

Ever since 1776 there has been a string of transfor


- Everything is run by software - and software illiteracy will be as debilitating to people, compnaies and socoeotes as language illiteracy


social media - its the piblic square and those shouid be pubkic / owned / controled / answerabke / regukated 

- coders are the new managers 
(the typing pool takes over the Boardroom)

was designing the company 
now is supoorting and coaching the developers
(books - porter vs google manager)

Mgmt has a co-ordination rooe but software very good at that

so if SRE is what uiu get when you ask a software engineer to design a xxx what fonyou get when you asknone to design a company

soppy

but touches on cirruption ans  corrusion - mgmt is needed when the realmunderlying activity of the company cannot be written down because it is different tonwhat people say

jim crow (and why americans love their guns) 



(also its about driving a car - guiding. it is easier to have one person make the decisions butbwhat if they make bad decisions - democracy is about removing them  - but what if we just have agreed models and see where things are going and ... democracy is not the end poitn here. it about guiding a society or an organisation.  which is why inam excited about idea of breaking out of UK Ltd company model because it aloows experimentation in democracy at some decent sxale)



- double down on democracy
(if the machines do as they are told, who needs slaves?)
Chinas totalitarian bet

- but that implies more aharing of wealth 
Sharing? Why this form of capitalism

- corruption and corrusion in organisations - its everywhere
Is capitalism eveworking? All profits went to traders.

corrupt
corroded
cononerate

loss of foxus

secondary conjectures and implications
--------------------------

Lo-code and No-code is a joke

The virtual world makes measuring the real world possible, and at
greater detail than we imagine

The social media furire is really one of sudden access to data - like
London pea souper cleqring out

conversations online are terrible - but they were offline we just coukd ignore it.

Twitter has *exposed* - celebrities are less glamorous because we read what they actually think - and this applies to politicians too.  thatcher being defenestrated seeems more dignified becauae we got filtered through news reporters and press offices.  it was the same features however.

So this is just seeing clearer - pea souper blown away.  and we can either dealnworh it or put the pea souoer backndown (and this allow control and corruption tonthise elites with better access

online reviews. Yiur friendss will happily abuse your friendship to make a profot offline (see tipperware parties and all pyramid schemes)

The digital mirror
------------------

The virtiak world is reflecting back on us our world and at vaster scale - and the problems we see are ones of degree not quality - they always existed we were just not dealing with it

Think of it as civil roghts era.

We shall see this thoroughout as we find industries and unfairness that is revealed and we have to decide what if anything to do about it

my take is in the end we all want to moce to fairer workd - and we shall. advice is donthe radical now because in thirty years it will be obvious 

digital activity leaves nonwheee to hide.

important thing is to focus eegukation on the real menaingful thing.
Freedom?

Chinese totalitarian bet - our bet is on freedom through respectful
politelness


class war
---------

"""class war has always been between those who work for a living and those who own for a living"""

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_Our_Wealth

coders are new managers 
-----------------------

Look at Peter Dricker and the google eight rules.  what a bunch of pussies


- software is used to *run* companies day to day (algo trading is affecting liquidity ?)

- so compnaies are basically versioned - coders are new managers. managers were building a compnay deisnging its processes 

- not remore working but async working

- loans as example - now decision is based on credit score.  this is not a hige difference from chinees social score (its whatvis unofficially kept anyway)

- Biggest implication is trolley problem. We will have to decide (and decide hiw ti decide) all thise horrivle edge cases.  This will get nasty in democeacy, especially as people will try and use code in politics

- we will see many issues currntly seen in crypto - what oracle do we use to trigger some situation in code? how do we habdle the "oh we did not mean that" problem 

- ooen source society (segue to society)




The software mind is the meta mind of annorganisation  - hownit thinos (slow fast AI) and how that chnages in a world of software literacy



Neuromancer and Demon internet - the cirtualmconnecting to the physical - this is the dream but it is also a noghtmare of control - the current beneficiaries and managers are due to lose out 

there is no such thing as a free market / software socialism - the virtual workd measures and raises to a level of visibility - thisnwill disrupt corruption and corrosion (in companies and leseqhere )


Softeare and ghe paved road
--------/---------------///
https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/06/paved-paas-netflix/

Within the Netflix technical stack, functionality provided by the PaaS includes microservice Remote Procedure Calling (RPC), service discovery and registration, operating system, application runtime, configuration, metrics, logging, tracing, dashboards, alerts and stream processing.

At some point you need these as business building blocls - cloud is not servrrs its services thst worl in sensble ways - ifs not putting saas togethe rwoth ifttt its codijg reql apis and real data. it feels different 

90% of it will looknlike from people import person - select all persons with contract > 1 year

This is viaion of fitute company - all the siloed functions of company (hr, finance, etc) and access to roam across then. jupyer notevook style


leadership
----------
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Dowding

"""Beyond the critical importance of the overall system of integrated air defence which he had developed for Fighter Command, his major contribution was to marshal resources behind the scenes (including replacement aircraft and air crew) and to maintain a significant fighter reserve, while leaving his subordinate commanders' hands largely free to run the battle in detail."""

Changes in compmaies
--------------------

- Project management 
Project management is promarily programme mgmt - co-ordination between different projects. Its not some clever methodology that will make the current single project magically work better.  You can do that with a decent todo list (hence joel spolsky)

The provlem is co-ordinating between projects to a oid catastrpphe - see the thing abiut tubnel under airprirt that was too small

You *could* donthis by careful planning - but in software world its simpler easier more eliable to write tests and stuc out - this explains growthbof mixroservices (which match bausiness functions)

expand to inclide - large baujess taxonomies and service mapping (shoukdnbe managing 1000s of movroservoces

so a companu that cannot introspect its current state is goign to need project mgmt - but onbthat can, can test next state releases and so on can make progress - without prject mgm - and that is proceless



Micro sevices - stop trying to control it in one persons head - the abstractions are too large to be useful 
 microservices show the actual useful units if process / acticity - and are hiw business should arenage itself 
 
 and they need to be manages not woth "thats bobs area" bur with groahviz ans software 
 - need to become software literate 



Democracy
---------
https://polite.technology/preview

https://www.nceo.org/article/research-employee-ownership

I think that the arreival of voting on features will transform the democracy of companies - if we all vote we all have reaource allocation control (so some peoplee get more votes - thats going to be interesting)  but alos whomundersrand the implixations

this requires discussion 
and likely micro services 

Content moderation ans Robert E Lee
----------------------
We are aearching for the glovally acceptable minimum set of content guidelines

Its goin to be tough - but it will need to be coherent - enough to write rules and not use AI!

We are aeeing re-evaluation of confederare symbols - they were rebels after all - and one of those global minimums is likely to be equality before the law.  

the most likely global miminum is un human rughts declration

then content moderation stops and younsimply become a punlisher - why bother moderating content - if yiu are selecting contrnt to show over other content that makes yiu .. a publisher? 

Even nazis need a safe space
--------------
Everyones lived experience gets then to a certain set of opinions in life - and while almsot everyone is willing to chnage they have a himan need to be recognised where they are and be part if the conversation ans conversion

because internt and social media and gloaboisation is requireing us to find new common ground - what is and is not acceptable

conclusion
----------
We will see a new mind. Faster
fairer
if we xhoose tonnake it so

we worrybabout democracy backsliding - but I thinknit has a bright fuutre (70 ywars old) and software, freely abailableninformation and the correct labelling of sata for the Slow AI of society will lead to a gloriuos future

coders as managers
-------------------

1950 to 2010
Porter to Google

managers now trying to be coaches and faciltators but also command and control

previously command and control was what eqs needed becaus you need tonbuild a system and a machije as an orgaalnisatikn - and if all youbhave are people and pens then you need a command and control point

but what if you have spmething like aoftware that has nonego, can communicate to 1 or 100 people and not be creative but can make decisions ?

then building the software is the act of buikding a system - and the  you dont need the human hierarchy - you just have a computer telling you what to do.

directing the bersion of the orgbaiatikbs you have bow

the impicaions are huge - you need to be explixt as tonthe aims of the orgnaisation (corruption corrrosion, racism jim crow)

and it newns org can be self evovling - self modelling

management is understood generally wrong like generalship is understood wrong - it is not tactical genius on the battlefield, calling out intricate orders - mostly because those orders would not be heard 

and like generalship management is missing some of the understandings - that deploying people to a project is the only lever managers at most levels have 

effective management levels
- top level assigning all money
build me a mix of tanks and artillery in this order for this mission - build orders and capital ships

- colonel level - how to run a tank battalion, have bough trucks following the tanks with shells and fuel - training and logiticis 

- sergeant level - clean the oil filter on that tank  - keep to training in day to day - 

- grunt levle - fire the gun 

three things

* an army and a company is a built function - it does what it is built to do. an army of tanks cannot fight a naval battle, a company of web services is going to struggle running a logistics company


* the doctrine for companies is changing to be software first.  Like motrorised first.  this changes everything - if the front end is software literate the whole company mist become so or it holds back 


* a model of the battle scape enables ... not movement by moment tactical decisions but less tactical freedom - the freedom to experiment is going - so it is m much more likely to be a immutable company 

A general times the oace of march - that is marching soldiers at right oace is soooo important the damn general is recommended tonso it (1917) during the march on a reg basis.  !!!

Software is cooking oil 
-----------------------
Eating the workd is fine but more relevant is that software will be necesarybbut not sifficuent in every industry bar tech

Disney now has more stresming sibs than netflix - because while getting strenaing right is software oroblem and a hard one, the leverage in straming is donyou have the content people want to watch.

watch dor same in car and construction etc 

Built the less than ideal thing
------------------

Military are built - tools designed fir a specific set of uses.  See russian ukraine war 

but so is everything else in hunan rehxnological era

compnaies are built dor a specific size and use - they grow till they no longer fot the environemnt

urban  entrea ar ebuikt - and our quality of life as welm as our exonomic xapabilities are built too.  A farm that has no roads away from the farm and too a market cannot supply oyher food.

Coties that have bonpublic spaces cannot have mixing and random serendiptios shortcuts 

And our politics are built - we sell manifestos lead by politicians but it is built by rukes and parties 

Look at energy use - we use about 40*3000*4 joules 480KJ per day (transport heating farming etc etc) - thats about 40 humans or think ofnit as slaves.  Now if you had 40 (robot) servants working for you per day, would you have designed the life you live now? would you have built this life? this way? 

f not then we have a gap - the SRE gap - the diff between the company, the urban, the society we have now, and the society we could have if it was designed by software literates.
