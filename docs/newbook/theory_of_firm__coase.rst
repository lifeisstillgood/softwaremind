=======================
Theory of firm - Coase
=======================

why are some companies big - because they can aborb capital
in defined way

banks
real estate (mcdinalds starbucks)
commodity producers of high capital goods - steel, coal, not coffee or bananas

with some variation on regulatory politxsl capture

pirchase servivrs in market

but knowledge work will never have
such high capital cost (AI?)

foss drives down like literacy

only the writing we rely on - and only one law

so its opennrss about product and location (ledgers)
that will drive next eave of cheapness 

that and robotic production, distribution

aggregation not innovation??? 


SOme concepts:

* Coase - why are firms not tiny and use market for co-ordiantion
* Chandler - similar question - plus "iron law of bureaucracy"

Economic Scale has built "the state" and the "miliary" and has built "para-state" companies
(banks, utilities, major commodity production like steel, pharma)

But these are *built* like militaries are - for a particular purpose.
When they no longer fit the purpose they have to be rebuilt. 
But their structure (and management) will create inertia (resistence)

Its not as malicious as perhaps chandler sees - most manager see the way the
wind is blowing, and looks to position themselves.  But it is not market
competition.

THe too big to fail problem


But can programabnle company offer a new answer - by allowing

* clear SOP changes
* whole org test rigs to allow modelling, faster feedback etc.
* robotic self view - whole org test, but also perception, feedback, actions
* openness - i mean why was it so long for nayone to see the big short?





Alfred Chandler - The visible hand

Managerial Capitalism (those who take the rewards)
Stability and suruval of org - ie "iron law bureaucracy"
No market pressure / insulated market pressure.



What determines right size of a firm. What determines who gets to change the encoding of a programmable company. How much deep state can be repalced by re-programming a company.  Who acts int ehc ompany and who acts on the company
