that's not the argument the article was making - they note that tech and media (the fastest growing sectors, which not coincidentally employ most intensively IT workers) are just 5% of economy.

the argument is that when the rest of the economy employs IT at the same level of intensity, the remaining 95% will have similar productivity growth and hence see gains of wealth creation.

we then have to work out how to distribute those gains (hopefully fairly and equitably)

There is a oft quoted parallel with electricity replacing steam in factories- it took a generation or more for factories to stop being clustered around one large steam engine, running each corner of the factory to the speed of one central spindle.  the idea is that eventually companies will adapt to use "Digital" rather than adapting digital to fit them.
