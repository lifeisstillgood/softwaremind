This is a issue of *public order*.  If some idiot stands on a street corner and performs an anti-social act (varies based on jurisdiction, location, weather, gender, who is likely to be watching) then a state actor (the local beat cop) takes some action.

If they do the same in a pub / bar then the bar owner takes some action, with the implicit or explicit help of same state actor earlier.

If a printer / publisher receives an anti-social act in writing (hmm, harder to imagine but ok.  Holocaust denial in Berlin ? 

Now we move to an online location - a platform.

Look this must be pretty obvious surely? 

actually no - defining what is anti-social is hard and almost impossible to move globally.  we will probably see balkanisation based around language first.  which will lean heavily on jurisdiction

 

Philosophy 
Marx defines production as important part of industrial society

what is software society going to be defined through - being on time as a worker is unlikely to remain as a necessary behaviour

what else is going to change? (delver into marx suoerstructure)

Content Moderation - the problem is not what we think it is 
----------------------

Major points
- How does page rank work 
- really all FAANG is doing is watching our behaviour in ways never possible before - the value lies in the data provided by human behaviour
- if data created by us is actually owlur property and legal presumption about its transferability is changed then most of value of these huge corps goes away

- we need to see a new legal environment - with those changes 

- my activity on and offline is valuable - but not to simply
make me a target for another sale 
(pet peeve - tv menus - loads first into "buy now" not "watch what you already have")

- scale is huge confounding issue

- but scale does not change essence

- this is personal data ownership

- The OS of social media is really the behaviour of humans - the So called AI will go where the data points tell it and we produce the data points - so the bugs in the new OS are bugs in human cognition.

Hence we need regulation to tell the AI what it should do when the data leads it astray - see software that won't hire women because they don't get promoted at this company

So now we are back to the old problem - what kind of society do we want to build.  Software won't help us choose.

but it can help us objectively measure 

Which leads to MOOPs and data sharing etc

We can find the ideals - and be guided by the experience of millions of precious.  

The wisdom of the crowds can span the ages now - the wisdom of the crowds will be found by following / choosing the curation of millions of people who turned out like us - be like your hero.

Listen to ben evans on content moderation 

- coties accept certain levels of crime / drug laws adjust what is crime - but we cannot eliminate 

so sme for 

but different crimes 

Society still needs to define what is acceptable
- the history and development of cities - new layouts, improved social areas (building churches)

So we need more tent pole events inline - more I Loce Lucy 

We have a scaling problem now - all scientists alive now more than have ever lived since 1980
