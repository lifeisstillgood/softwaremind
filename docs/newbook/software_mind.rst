We co-operate at enourmous levels, with teams, companies, governments, 
                                nations all forming networks. And these networks carry more than trade or goods - they *learn* - reinforce like tensors. Our organisations are (clay shirkey) Slow AIs.  
Journalism is data labelling for the slow AI of society - what we know as truth (see culture wars for deifnton of truth)
But why is there no journalism inside corporations - teh essence of totalitairanism is asserting truth not using scieticifc method to find it or open discussion to aggree on it.  SO will corproate democracy push internal journalism
