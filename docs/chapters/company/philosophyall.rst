When Richard Feynman died in 1988, his chalkboard at CalTech contained
several notes, including the one that has struck such a cord with me

::

  What I cannot create I do not understand

This says *everything* I want to say about why Open Source Software is
important, why re-creating the existing work is important, why open
and transparent - ness works, why things need to be evovled not designed
and why, we cannot understand everything.

It takes a genius to put all that in 8 words.


So, what can be extracted from eight words.

* Build from scratch
* Open Source keeps re-inventing the wheel
* software is evolved
* relax.

Build from scratch
------------------

One of my software development tenets is you should be able to *build
your whole systems from scratch*.  That is given bare metal hardware,
get up and running, not from a few lucky backups and _dd_ but from
controlled scripted installs.

I have always thought this vital - without being able to (re)create
your systems, how do you know if you can in a disaster, or more
importantly that you can when it is not a disaster.  ITs impossible to
believe that the first time you installed your webserver you got it
perfect, first time, but if you cannot rebuild it with confidence, you
just will put off rebuilding it again and again until it is a mess of
libraries, patches and symlinks that you could never hope to remmeberm
nor worse, simplifiy.  Now expand that to your DNS, file server, your
database.

But being able to run a simple script, and the system is configured,
that makes life so much simpler.  I can read the script and see what it
will do.  I can change it, experiment, confident that I can just rerun
the original and get back to where I started.  And I can run the script
and go do something more interesting.

And no, I do not believe in _dd_, _ghost_ or other image based
methods.  Yes, they are very nice for Virtualisation, but always there
is a flaw - to get to an image, one has to build the original.  If you
build the original by hand, how do you know what steps you took - how
sure can you be? The Sysadmin was very careful?  Was he? Thats nice.
Oh look a new patch is out, and we no longer want to use version 5.2.2
of php and can we put the incompatible library onto only half of the
hosts.  Can you rebuild all of the images to do that, by tomorrow?
Still going to be careful are you?


Build from scripts, from scratch.

And you know what, I finally worked out why I was so insistent on this,
in the face of others desire to take the easy route.  Quite simply because
I did not understand a system till I had wrestled it enough to automate it.

You find out where all the gaps are when you try and automate a system.


Re-inventing the wheel
----------------------
I am (re)writing a ER diagramming tool, for about the third time. This time no
funny copyright issues with my employers, I swear.

But there are many ER tools out there. And there are many languages, databases,
games and more.  This does not stop us from writing another, just as
the existence of a Haynes car manual does not stop people from taking their
car engine apart.  We do it because we do not understand, and we want to learn.

Sometimes, there is an itch to scratch.  But often the itch is for knowledge,
and the desire to know if we *can*.  Benefiting the rest of the world is what we
do to share our knowledge.


Evolution
---------

Because we have to re-invent the wheel to teach the next generation,
we tend to incrementally improve.  And that is a slow evolutionary process.

Software *evolves* to fit its niche.

Relax
-----

I am sometimes troubled by comparing myself to some of life's winners.  But
looking at Feynman makes those comparisons silly.  A genius that other genius'
thought a genius, he still tried to understand this strange world we live in,
and had no more a grasp on *why* than the rest of us poor schmucks.

So, we do what we can.  And move the world on a little bit.  Some more than
others, I must admit, but I am happy to be pushing it in the right direction.
==============================
Price of gold is fairly stable
==============================

------------------------------

I do love me a bit of Ancient Rome.  And I love the term Solid - it came from the solidus, a gold coin minted by Constantine 315AD

Domain have done some amateur digging and will try the following: in Neros day 2 denarii would buy a Modius, which was sufficent grain for ten days for one average male (two one pound loaves a day, there is a diet to make wheat intolerant weep)

Now the aureus was replaced by the solidus, but it was about 25 denarii.  So we can say that one gold coin bought you about 100 -120 days worth of basic food.

A kuggerand is about four times the weight of gold as a aureus, and it's about £1,000 to buy today. And at £3 per day I could carefully feed myself.  Certainly in bread alone.

So over nearly 2000 years, a gold coin is roughly enough to feed one man for three months.

Fascinating

What a foul up
==============

==============
(this is posted here because I can't post over 2000 characters to HN and I wanted a bit more space)

So, I made a dick move yesterday. I misunderstood someone's comment (or I misunderstood their intention) and ... well @dang accused me of racewar and something about stone tablets and science.

I was of course outraged and reacted. Then a minute later I took a deep breath and reacted better.

We all value our reputation and having a judgement so clearly divergent from my own self perception has caused some internal reflection.

You see, there is an old joke about the definition of a liberal - a conservative who just got arrested.

Looking at my self in the mirror, I still see a sensible well balanced person, with strong liberal tendencies (who has worked at the UK version of ACLU, organised anti-intimidation watchdogs at voting booths in racially charge elections in London, and so on - things which while true when repeated here they still sound hollowly like "some of my best friends are")

I am sure dang and the other hard working moderators see a lot of crap in their job.  I am of course *certain* that that was not what I meant - who me?

Except that one thing middle age teaches you is that, quite often, it is you.

So yes, when someone arrives with a Vote Trump T shirt they probably do not find HN an easy place to discuss things in the terms they usually use.  And they will I am sure always protest "but it was not me, but what I said was perfectly sensible debate / free speech, how dare you accuse me like that, gosh you should treat people better around here, I am off to Breightbart"

But just like the recently arrested conservative I want to say just that (well not the breightbart bit obviously, but I certainly felt ill-used. Especially the bit about "other breaches of the guidelines in my previous history". Yeah gulp. I have asked for a list - in my case because I want to analyse and improve. Clearly those other cases where people ask they are just indignant)

But no matter what, I have been sorted into the basket of deplorables.

- Did I make a mistake and step down the slippery slope thinking I had good grips on my shoes?

- Did I not notice the slope?

- Am I actually deplorable?

- Or is it all the fault of those evil moderators ?

Actually this last point is not fair. I have reread the post and - I really failed to convey my thoughts. What is posted there is ... a horrific comment. (I can remember what I meant. I can see where I missed out indicative punctuation. But thats not the point is it.) Totally not what I meant and hopefully would never ever think. But someone I respect has come back with "well thats not actually out of character for you Paul.  We were thinking of banning your account for some of the stuff you have said".  That has shaken me deeply and I would like to know what has lead them there.  And how can I adjust my public statements to better reflect me.

So I herewith apologise to everyone on HN or elsewhere for posting text that reads so horrifically. Even if I did not mean it, I still wrote it.

I also need to think about why I post stuff too quickly, why I chose such am inflammatory subject to post on anyway, and why I did not review.

Fewer words. More thought.

I am going to take a bit of a break.

I have spent many years on HN (and am probably a little too anxious to be this close to 10,000).

Apart from satirical news shows on radio 4, it's my main source of information on the world. (This may of course not be a great thing.)

So a break is called for - I check too often, and while Facebook is often criticised by us for its addictive-like properties, I still obsessively check HN morning and night and am sooo close to 10k and my last couple of submissions did feel more like testing the reactions for points, not sharing something.


(Actually re-re-re-reading my offending post I can see I meant to put a question mark (or more ??!!) at the end of the first paragraph - so a challenge to the poster looks a lot like a statement of .. oh fuck me what a disaster.  I was remembering what I meant, not reading what I actually wrote.  It really does read like a trolling post - I can quite see what happened there.  But the "other posts violating our guidelines" indicates its a good time to take a break till I have processed things.)

The Journey of Mikado Software
==============================

==============================

The journey to freedom
----------------------

I was made redundant in 2008, from a nice CTO job in London's City, at the
height of the financial crisis.

Now, I have worked in the "Internet Industry" since 1995.  Yes I am that old.
And I have done most jobs, from CTO to consultant, Developer to DBA.  I ran some
of the UK's first ADSL trials back when 14.4 modem was a big deal, have written
software for the FTSE100 and the footie club.  And so I decided not to take
it lying down.

Two weeks later, I walked into a new contracting job, and I hustled, and hunted,
worked my way up the salary ladder, started my own consultancy and landed the
*big gig*.

It was the worst move I ever made.

I sat in a car for between 2 and 4 hours a day (and I never knew how long the
trip would be).  And I was not curing cancer so I could hardly claim my work was
worth the sacrifice.

.. figure:: /assets/images/m25.jpg

I saw my children only when they were asleep, or at weekends, when I was
exhausted. My wife saw me for about ten minutes before we climbed into bed and
slept shattered.  It put strains on my marriage and our kids.

And I put on nearly two stone.

So, as that contract ended, I swore to stop.  I did not need to actually be in an office, watched to see if I was slacking off.  I could work remotely, from
anywhere, for anyone.

And things turned a corner.  I was able to walk into
work, able to make breakfast for my kids, let my wife have a lie in and a cuppa.[#]_

It is not heaven, bills still need to be paid, relationships repaired, the office is tiny.

But like nearly 3 out of 4 workers, my job does not need to involve me
travelling to the same office as everyone else.  Nearly 75% of us could do the
same job from *anywhere*.  And we could do it minutes from our families, our
lives.

The more of us who make that break, who escape, the more our societies will
shift.  Till raising a family stops being a struggle that tears us from being
productive in work.


The journey for freedom
-----------------------

One of the defining characteristics of the next decade of the Internet is
the vast, vast amount of data that will be available, and the new insights
that data will afford us.  But it is too much data for any one company to
own it and use it.  All the pharamceutical companies will need to share their results to find the next break throughs, all the financial companies will need to
share their trades to avoid the next crash.

Data will have to be *open* to be *big* and with that will come the open software to handle the data, and the open forms of working (like above) that will
be used to write the software.

And this is my second journey - I am a `passionate believer
<http://www.oss4gov.org/manifesto>`_ in the role of open source in public sector
software.  Mikado Software is driven to put high quality, open software into
government and public sector hands.  We are not a lone voice, the new NHS Spine2 will be built on the open source Python language (a speciality of Mikado) and the Government Digital Service is not just revamping websites, but pushing the
very defintion of Open and Agile into the heart of UK government.

Journey's End
-------------

I care passionately about my family, which makes me not unique.  I also care
passionately that governments, councils and citizens all have the right to read
the software that more and more runs our lives.  The right to read it, critique
it, and one day remove the offending code.  Just as we do with our written laws
today.

Software matters now, and will matter more in the future.  It need to be kept
free and open so the laws that run our lives are as accessible as the laws that
govern us.

Mikado Software is the end of two journeys, a company that treats work that can
be done anywhere as an opportunity to work anywhere, and a company that creates
the future of public services.

Topless computing
=================

(June 2007)

Not nearly as much fun as it sounds
===================================

The other day I was asked by a member of staff if it would be possible to tie
the holiday spreadsheet into the master workplanner application.

Now *possible* is a horrible word for IT people, because it is *always*
possible.  Its really a question of is it a good idea.

I said, well, not until the holiday recording was taken out of spreadsheet form
and put into something that was less ... topless.

Yes, I got the eyebrow reaction.

However it does make sense.  We do not know what the future is going to hold, so
it is always sensible to put our data and code into a form that makes it easy /
simple / feasible to build another system on top of it.

In other words we should build our systems to be **top-less**.

Of course, like in the real world, there are varying degrees of topless.  A
spreadsheet is possible to extract data from.  Perhaps I could write a
Python-server that looked at Excel at one end and spat out HTML / JSON the
other. But then I need to map employeeIDs between excel and this other thing,
and write some interpreter for the weird way the spreadsheet deals with time,
and it would probably be a good idea to cache the dates for speed, which means a
storage engine, and by this time I have written yet another half-assed
application, that still does not handle half-days sick, nor talk to the payroll,
nor know anything about regulations.

But to get rid of it will mean *me* going off finding a list of decent payroll
applications, and asking if they are topless.

Which always makes for a fun phone call.


To me **topless computing** is really, truly **user-friendly** software.  But by
that I assume there are computer literate users being considered.  Because
user-friendly does not mean it has a nice UI, it does not mean it has predictive
text.  It means that when I want to extend it, it does not get in the way.
(Some describe this as difference between *plumbing* and *porcelain*).

If all users could write source code, all programs would be topless. Or at least
have easy to remove bikinis. [#]_ And that is ultimately why I go around talking
about topless computing.

Because it sounds naughty.

Basically, I need to get the old stuff out of my brain and down onto paper, or at least blogroll, so I can go and
have fun learning some new stuff.

I hope you enjoy what is getting pushed out of my brain.  I also hope it helps you.
