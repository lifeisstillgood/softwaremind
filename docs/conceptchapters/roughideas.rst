Introduction
-------------

Predicting the future is like trying to hike in a thick fog.  You can feel if the landscape is rising or falling, but pretending you know how far up the hill goes is a fools game.  Similarly, Warren Buffet likens timing the market to crystal ball gazing.

Technology is humankinds great invention - and yet it constantly changes the game - The mountains underneath our feet are shifting - some rising like software, some falling like Aluminium cutlery.

In the 1860s, Napoleon III hosted a banquet with cutlery made, not from silver or even gold, but from the then-fantastically expensive and precious metal - Aluminium.  Quite how he would have reacted to seeing how we toss away Coke cans is beyond me.  But his amazement is not birthed in changing fashions, or more industrious use of slaves, but in a technological leap that simply changed the economics of the world so much that Napolean II's mental model was no longer useful to him.

The arrival of the Internet has provoked a shift in the economics of transactions between every person on the planet.  The ramifications of this did not stop with a few big Silicon Valley IPOs but will continue to play out for decades.  The impact of free unlimited communication between individuals will impact governments, businesses, and individuals.

On top of this other maturing science is threatening to overturn our assumptions as surely as Napoleon III's - The science of articifically growing meat resulted in eating a beef burger worth 100,000 dollars in front of the press.  But no one is betting that similar burgers will never come down to restaurant prices.  

I have spent my professional adult career in the internet business, developer, manager, consultant and entreprenuer.  I have managed to live through hyper growth, spectacular launches,failed websites and  bankruptcy.  I have developed a nose for what is going to hit and how much it will hurt.

I am probably wrong in the specifics and the order of impacts - but I have learnt you only need to be standing in the right place once.  And there are many right places to stand.









New Software architectures
Business Operating System

New enabling technologies
Search for basic income
EuroZone and the quest for country sized sharing and playing nice




Data store: pickle objects and store in a "container" object that holds metadata 
Indexing is ... ?? 

This becomes the basic backbone of data storGe - store the file.  It is getting away from the RDBMS idea

How does it change the CoW problem? 

What else?

Message queue and zeroMQ
Hdf5 for tabular data 

Purchase orders etc - store as an object

Store documents in mongo or couch ... ???
Why build own store??? 

Major trends 

Distributed / decentralised 
- Bitcoin is trying this - by removing fiat the power is diffused.  As such it makes local decision making more likely
- political decentralisation 
- software decentralisation. 

Over arching thesis
- software literacy and the shape of the future fog

- radical action
It's not reckless action, but it must move a significant percentage of the economy and population - otherwise why bother having governments do it?

The UK is in the middle of a general election campaign, and every party's election promises are being shown and compared.  And they are all, with few slightly nutty exceptions, *small* changes to the status quo.

And it is similar across the western world.  "Change" is what everyone wants, but when you add up the figures, most change pales into insignificance compared to what does not change.

I think that if a party's policies, in toto, will not move the needle more than say 10% of GDP, why are we electing them?  Things are good - but they are not that good.





- software is eating the world - here are the restaurant reviews. 
- blog and podcast to discuss these.

Projects
- OSS
Campaigns
- kids experiments 
- oss4gov
Etc

Healthcare: the highly leveraged US hospital based healthcare system looks fragile in the face of three pronged attacks:

- vastly improved micro-diagnostics (diagnostics on a chip, sonar grams on laptops etc, computer assisted diagnosis, fit bits)
- local procedures - my most recent surgery 
- mass procedures - Russian eye surgery, vaccination days

I see a Singapore style approach - forced saving for life long minor procedures and insurance for major procedures, combining with clearer diagnosis and localised out patient services. 

We can also see likelihood of health taxes. Want that Mars bar ? 20 quid tax.



New software architectures
------------
Parallel stream processing - the data is passed in (over network) because having all applications assuming they hold a database that is CoW is far far more frustrating for systems integration than all applications assuming messages and data and streams will be sent to them and they will process and inwardly pass on

This is as big a shift as client server in the 80s

And it means we devs get to rewrite everything - again! Cha-Ching! 

Add to this the move off RDBMS to hsf5, the move to platforms and business operating system and move to proper PKI and we are doing well.


Security
--------
Marc Andreessen podcast - target attack and fired CEO. This leaves the board I. Clear position. They want valid security audits, and the CTO in better position - she will have Board level air cover to turn to the business and say "only critical bug fixes for six mths while we sort his out"

A whole industry of "introducing security best practises".  

That's my book :-)


Software 
=======

Software literacy
Software is eating the world

Openness
Open source software
Transparent decision making
Transaction costs falling to make theory of the firm less attractive

Death of the commute 

Government - evidence-based policy
Government - open source

OTC and open markets (EMIR) regulations are basically saying if you make a trade you need to tell the world how much and with whom.  It is open trading.  The debt was hidden by ability of two parties to both claim a profit off the same derivative transaction.

Frictionless enterprise 
Friction in pricing adjustments

Guided like warehouse pickers




Ideas with outsized impact 
-------------------------------
"Open"
This is one of those soft, vague words.  But in the Software world it has gained a real definition as part of the Open Source Software movement.

Suffice to say that the marginal cost of producing new software dropped below the cost of free time for most Western developers.  A this point a driven software programmer could create new program's, often better program's than commercially available. This drop occurred almost simultaneously with the drop in communication price ushered in by the internet.  And a new movement was born - programmers linked by free email, exchanging software program's and building the new generation of software - and having to find new ways to do it.  

Openness has power - it is the ultimate trusted institution. What everyone knows is what everyone expects. What everyone expects, is.





Openness
- reputation
- privacy (all or nothing)
- big data - too big to hoard
- open kills many management jobs

Openness - by making auditing easier we need openness - and at a certain point we just audit by auditing every transaction - see birth of NCR.


Openness matters in reputation

In February a man I had never met held a knife to the throat of my son, and I paid him thousands of pounds. Luckily he was a respected surgeon performing a routine adenoidectomy.  But why would I let him do that? Because he was monitored, reviewed and approved by his peers using "openness".  He had no fears of his actions being avaialble to be scrutinised by his peers or an interested public.

Openness matters in privacy
We all spy or no-one spies.  Since someone will always try to pay we should probably go for all spy. 

This is my default position on privacy - that the benefits of openness and shared data are so great the downsides will be best managed.




Ownership of personal data
The most likely beneficial solution is that data 

As an aside, digital rights management is important - but the record company lawyers make us feel icky.
Digital rights might be able to enforce personal data and might be able to allow companies to defend / prevent damaging data loss.

Then again, maybe we are all better off completely open.


Death of privacy affects governments more than individuals.

@finance
It's amazing but finance globally is really really inefficient.  The profit margins of world banks is a good metric for this - but it is elsewhere too.

But really for a relatively simple act - a scrip as it were, we have terrible terrible abiities.  Swift is moving towards the idea, as is visa, but if we used pgp and had every bank ... Hmm and there is the point if the blockchain - who is to trust that I have assigned actual money to my scrip? 

If banks do not exist?

But if they do how do they survive? On reputation? 



@veganism
25% of green house has emissions come from growth, transport and preparation of meat.  We could extend the "greenhouse runway" by decades by "simply" giving up meat.  We tried fairly well with net caught tuna, and we were not going to lose major cities to the dolphins.

It kills no one, is cheaper, healthier - and amazingly unlikely to happen

Death of privacy for 
Failure of security services to work for the country - should be telling Apple their device is insecure and failing to protect our managers and ministers - but now they exploit it.
Legal definitions of national security
Cannot put the encryption genie into bottle without breaking security of transactions
Must look to traditional detective skills
And to resilience - something that will benefit us in the 21century


The end of money
- money can be seen as a record of value contributed.  As we do more electronically perhaps we can re think that so it is fairer ? 

Deception and authority on the internet.
To a large extent, the problem of finding authority on the internet is already solved - Google has done this with PageRank algorithm.

However this algorithm is public, but it's results are not.  This involves a discussion of intellectual property rights - and is going to be a major piece of social future discussion.  It is unreasonable that Google owns the rights to use a link as an indicator of trust.  But it is also unreasonable to argue that Google should make the results of it's spider public - they have expended energy and cost doing so, and have some right to the results

It is also unreasonable to say that I, having made a link, which cost me time and energy, should have no rights to the link.  But do I have rights to the derivative works (page ranking) based on my intellectual property? 

Future of advertising
http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/04/the-economists-tom-standage-on-digital-strategy-and-the-limits-of-a-model-based-on-advertising

Google advertising vs Apple advertising - leaks into privacy stances and so makes a huge difference in strategic stance in future.  


RoboWarrier and robocop

It suddenly occurred to me that robots will be better in (defensive) combat.  Already targeting systems "improve" human decisions (tanks fire at the most vulnerable parts of a human selected tank)

The existence of a laser able to kill a human combined with facial recognition and aiming, presents an interesting situation - a very very small number of humans could operate a very large number of gun emplacements.

In the end it matters little. We have been very good at killing our own kind for many years. 





Socrates and Economics
======================

THis is a divergance from the main discussion, so blip over if you like.
However i think this lays down a good argument

Economics is improved energy use for human utility
Socialsim / capitalsim
Shared capital - Romand aqueducts still csarrying water 2000 years later
All capitalism is is a foam on top of the capital helping us allocate scare resources in the quest to build new *shared* capital in our socialist utopia.

Socrates said so so it must be right.


We can see this in PG&E and Salt Lake Tribune
Salt lake tribune is now first local newspaper (pulitzer prize winnng)
to become a non-profit with IRS approval.  This is the start I feel of the migration of journalism from the "foam" of capitalism to the ocean of socialism -

compare this to the PG&E actions where they are turning off electircity to millions of users in case the electircity pylons fall over and start fires.

THe failure to put capital into burying the cables shows the failure of the foam to transition downwards.  



Induatrialisation of film
--------------------------

Hand crafted movies - 1.5 hrs of nice movie, then House -> 177 hours or 100 movies over 8 years.  artisanal ?
And youtubeoutput - fidget spinner factory levels of output

What parallels can we see? insurance companies? hourly 

It's not what is but what can be - just stretch the time codes, reduce the smallest fraction 

- uber smallest time you can hire a car for

- hiring garden equipment or hotels or theatre seats ? office buildings and so forth

- cities and strong towns - more use of same infrastructure 


Trended 
- greater time sliced use of same infrastructure 
- more use of financial options and approaches to monetise same infrastructure (apportion usage well)
- some will be free some charged - but the discovery of who gets access 
will be auctioned? 


Most Small Saas are programmable companies
---------------------------------

Use patio11 as a example but many HN era - wrote the code, it just runs until they change it

It's a running business - taking money etc but it never changes just does its thing

the constantly changed business e are larger and often less optimised for autonomous running 

Social media - 
--------------


it's just measuring the world - not changing it - people have always talked shit 


coronavirus issues below
-------------------------
Industries should have some form of obligatory insurance.  You see travel insurance - you could not claim back your trip due to corona because ReInsurance companies knew all about this and refused to insure (ok some people somewhere could buy a policy but that would be more than the cost of flights)

So this is risk hiding.  what was 2008 crisis - risk hiding - most problems are forms of risk hiding - actuaries are fairly good at it but things like actuaries for finance products (ratings agencies) were under regulatory capture

so ... look clear eyed at our problem

Physical v virtual

Build the new future

post globalisation
------------------
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22913809
new manufacturing can frantically shorten global supply chains - gigs factories / alien dreadnaughts

as that happens the european four pillars model becomes more useful as globalisation - equal rights and regulations not just trade

that makes us all more local but also more equal

china on wrong side of every argument there - USA weirdly on right side if it's democracy can survive 

Euro-style federalism is minimum regulatory set to ensure human individual freedom
and rights within state co operation / organisation that is needed for security and growth

(we only build more than subsistence w through a meta human framework like government and capitalism.  we want to keep those but avoid the bad bits.)  this is *hard*.  as in 10,000 years of farming surplus and maybe we got something right in past two hundred years.

Software offers a new platform - and that we must fight off tyrants and libertarians alike to ensure it delivers for us all.

fight the libertarians - it's about the driving license - because we need to exist in a world of cooperation - and not having driving licenses destroys that (choose which side of road)

same for tyrants - can argue there is a straw man tyrant - some tyrants do good things.  that's not the point 

global conundrums 
------------------

productivity  and gdp 

these are changing based on corona and software
software productivity is discussed elsewhere but hidden from productivity statistics - we need more super productive people (see whatsapp run by 30 engineers) but then more things for them to produce

and what is  wealth -> gdp : it misses a lot of stuff - we won't go back out to cinemas but might take more walks - in public parks, but walks in public parks hidden like child rearing housewives-

Additive country
-----------------

Ricardos law (each country focuses on what it does best) has an interesting problem when the additive country is considered - that country is always second best at something - human dedicated factories almost always going to do cheaper at margins

but 

do we compare two coats as they leave factory (country) or at the point of consumption- when we add in costs of "superstructure" (that french matrix philosopher baudelaire) is the superstructure of factory and cost of training workers higher or lower

Add in that workers can be trained in one country and then work remotely for another - do we see countries wanting to tax their brain export? or revert to american style taxation?

tax
----
finally the costs of corona - counties across globe have taken on cost of shutdown - and will defeat that cost via inflation or via taxation.  the second is most likely - and this is the end of software titans tax free status - and beginning of another idea of countries working with each other to catch tax avoiders - reglobalisation 


China politics etc
------------------
Not much to say except that the one big winking issue for "West"
will be supply chain verification - the volume of IP violations as standard is huge in china and so verification will have economic security and political benefits 

AI and dude you broke the future
--------------------------------
antipope -> Corporations are slow AIs

4chan is a faster AI as is HN 

different ways to control them - different people attracted to them (see the idea of always moderate or always find yourself to the right)


Economics and value
--------------------
there is no final optimisation that is possible in economics- 

Markets cannot have an optimal point because to trade two people need to disagree about value - that might be a failing market where there is at symmetry of data (lemons) which is exploitative but generally 

it might be time based (HFT) 

or it might be opportunity based - those with little cash need extortionate credit rates 

regulationninnecomics is thus inevitable 

but also - we can see where the exploitation is and where there is just gravitational pull 

institutions and governance are there to ensure ... fairness ... and that is hard to defined even if we all know it when we see it (monkeys)

The failure of project management is also failure of BlackScoles - if pricing options accurately was so useful at high precision - better than say human intuition / experience - then we would see amamzijglynbetter results - but the options markets aren't hundred times more profitable - and managing projects is not 100x easier with options - there are so many parameters that we cannot optimise (AI *might* be able to make better decisions but at this scale of project mmgmt what does it matter - human discussion helps achieve decent results whilst allowing for institutions and politics that come from deciding resource allocation

and so we go back to - politics and the need for companies to become more democratic 

We must double down on democracy 

The Permissions event horizon
--------------------
Using my own linux box or AWS cloud I can stand up a database and insert a line of data in a few seconds or minutes.

This enables rapid development 

In *every* large company I  have been in I have simply not known how, or it has taken weeks or months to find out how or even fractions of a year to get new hardware installed.

yes there is an embrace of cloud but the huge lent up demand 

this is part of director hazing - a sort of entrepreneur obstacle course - if you cannot find out how you don't have the gumption to continue 

the problem is at some point it will be easy enough for internal developers to (securely) create apps and use APIs to create services - and at this point  some issue happen - there will be so many new ideas and apps all trying to solve the same problems internal to a comlnay that winners will get picked not through attrition of the entrepreneurs obstacle course but direct ok that one - this will cause discontent amount most non chosen dev teams, and occasionally result in stupid picks getting through - meaning the next time everyone will demand a vote on which app to use (marketing etc)

it will also clearly point out that the number of developers and people actually needed is way way smaller (1/3) than currently.

It will also eliminate a large number of mod manager positions as expected. 

Cambrian internal explosions of applications and marketing options - which will look incredibly like democratic politics as opposed to the closed door politics of dictatorship 


Cyber security and liability
----------

we want better cyber security (see open hardware etc)

we shall see better results using a blame neutral system like NTSB (air crash investigation) - where breaches are reporters and the investigation continues and everything from the missing bolt to the organisational failures that lead to a missing bolt are highlighted and MRA raised.

but this needs legal changes even in one jurisdicatiob - and no good just not being liable in say sweden if same breach affects people in USA and india and they can sue. 



Will faang be regulated? 
------------------------
yes
look all the money that all western (russian and chinese and western, he'll all businesses) spend on advertising and on marketing are getting funnelled through a vanishingly small number of companies.  no matter how rich they are do we really think that five or ten businesses can take on *all* the others!  

a utility style solution seems most likely - but this will need international co ordination - or possibly yet another "ooops we did not understand the implications s change"
such as releasing all data as APIs or creation of a regulated PII data industry with medico-legal protections 

i like this - because i do not see privacy as a "human right".  privacy is not a single thing.

what is socially negative is the unfettered exploitation of PII data - being able to target me for a commercial or political advert or other engagement based on my past stored behaviours - we could see the change between personalised and contextualised ads and we should see an industry of owners of data that have hugely powerful regulatory smack downs that keep a data industry in check (but also needs a moral and social disgust which feels like it is coming) 

GDPR+ and ownership and fines and small industry of lawyers getting us payouts and NTSB style data protection rules and yet we get the benefits of data collection - look at the iwatch - the medical benefits of that in epidemiology will go for decades.

privacy - adverts try to tell me what to think / think about.  I don't like that 

What comes next
---------------
I have been in internet tiindustry since 1997 and constantly afraid i have missed the boat.  and missed a lot

but the next things

(ref ben evan)
look first fifty years of car industry was how to make a car - did it have a roof and window wipers etc

the next fifty were about the consequences of everyone having a car - highways and mcdonald's drove through a and walmart's and traffic jams and holidays at the beach and cliff richard roving a bus and ... 

Have we invented the mcdonald's drive through of the smart phone? have we invented the interstate highway? 

not yet - facebook is hopelessly trivial - a social graph.

what is coming next is the total recording and *improvement* of our lives - moop is first part.  but what will it mean to have ability to recap everyone you met? and place them on social graph that is a public record?

yes chinese administration controls a social credit score - what happens when social disapproval controls it ? 


What kind of company are you ?
---------------
is facebook a software company? Is netflix?
is bofa? 
- who is the prime regulator? 
netflix is regulated mostly as a TV company 
Facebook should be regulated as a ... advertising company 

it's more or less a new category but it's a advertising sale somcpnay 

is it? 




What is needed for AI to help us?
----------------------
https://medium.com/@mijordan3/artificial-intelligence-the-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet-5e1d5812e1e7

tie into Math destruction and lack of understanding of and controls over

basically we want to automate science and have provenance - and then apply politics and policy 

this is the software architect problem - we need to define and agree each step (ie the politics is over by the time the software is written - hence conways law) 

this ties everything together - and shows how hard this is going to be 


Weapons of math destruction
- algorithms must be understandable and openly published and auditable

Michael jordan 
Provenance - how to show that the decision made is based on good data, and has that data changed? this is interlsnly hard - it is basically all of science

Policy - this is which parts of science do you choose to ignore?

this provides a fascinating problem for the nazi party / extremenits - we are going to embed science (we hope) in these decisions 

there won't be a place to alter the provenance - it will be hard to choose your own facts.

What will be needed will be a weighting of facts (there are some things more important than money)

Additijally - we are rebuilding all global society - firstly away from hydro carbons and onto solar and secondly this new data infrastructure - that envelopes and guides us - with our best interests regulated and at heart

middle class champage socialists - it's the way ahead.

Oxford woman - privacy

Is there such a thing as privacy? regulation and the best interests of the individual - 

we will have hard dichotomies - basically for a medical
doctor in european system the decision is what is medically correct irrespective of cost

but what happens to society when all social decisions are "best for individual and irrespective of cost" - fairer distribution - mental health - early years and education - potential lending of abuse 

there is a utopia ahead - but will it look at all like what we think utopia should be? (star trek is a bit crap) 

Video game life for greater good

Record companies were modern day DeBeers
----------------------
University oF minnesota economist and author digital renaissance estimated in 2018 4 million new songs were added to Spotify and similar each year.

This means the record companies of the world in my era were acting like a cartel chocking off supply to increase price.

ben evans actually there is just that it depends on context of regulation - that oil is different in refinery in a parked car and in diesel powered ship


AI and SQL
----------
ben evans take 
Also history of tape drove was one dimensional view of data due to tape
then hard drive lead to multi dimensions as random access cost lowered
now ML is multi dimensional squares - but we don't decide the dimension to view - it's part of model
so academic underpinnings of ML missing  - so far 
"explicability" is likely not just good policy terms but for driving the field forward

Future of social media regulation
----------------------
https://stratechery.com/2021/internet-3-0-and-the-beginning-of-tech-history/

So twitter banned Trump.
This implies happily that twitter (faang) can ban any politician - so ... build your own twitter for china? ok - for Brazil? maybe, for lichenstein? yeah.  Perhaps open promtcol distributed systems - one that means no one can be banned - but then that loses the *discovery* portion (ie the algorithm)

(we need to split social
media platforms into multiple parts - protocol, discovery, advertising, etc)

But the point is that without regulation and with central control you can do better - how about hell banning politicians? I suspect it is possible :-) 

the problem here is also the differentiator of social media - that each person can get different personalised feeds. If i read one newspaper I have read them all - but what if each news paper carried different articles and front pages? how would you know what reach that PR piece got?

Everyone gets hell banned. 


Software is learning 
--------------------
Literacy argument redux:

Look if you write down your essential business processes you would find new learnings and efficiencies. (see that electrical guy). this is often writing down the policy manual

Now if you outsource your writing down the policy manual to a third party offshore policy manual writer, effectively you just became a franchise owner.

same with software - you might get a running system but the essential knowledge left your company.

metric driven development 
-------------------------
I have occsssionally espoused "metric-driven-development" where a metric is defined and measured and then a release is tagged with that metric - and over a period the release is seen as a success or fail if it moves the metric.

This keeps everything focused on the important usually externally facing issues.

Data Colours
------------

we need ways to colour data - store it always under data types and keep it coloured - ie this belongs to a person etc
