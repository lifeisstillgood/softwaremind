My friend, Jefferson's an American saint because he wrote the words, "All men are created
equal." Words he clearly didn't believe, since he allowed his own children to live in
slavery. He was a rich wine snob who was sick of paying taxes to the Brits. So yeah, he
wrote some lovely words and aroused the rabble, and they went out and died for those
words, while he sat back and drank his wine and f***ed his slave girl. This guy wants to
tell me we're living in a community. Don't make me laugh. I'm living in America, and in
America, you're on your own. America's not a country. It's just a business. Now f***ing
pay me.

There are many people gocing thier work for benefit of others
(vaxxers), and foss is amoung this.
business is the froth on top, the dostribution
once we enter the regukated zone, the utilities, the criminal activity, wven the onsoder
trading laws,
then we stoo being red in tooth and claw and we see proft not
"business" can be either a parasite onnsociwty or a driver to greater heights.
its not terribly clear which so we need to be clver and see balance in public and provate

My thinking on this is trying to evolve but it’s something like
- no software provider commercial or otherwise provides warranty. Microsoft Office is “as
is” whoever you are. Some companies are big enough to get to be at the table where the
roadmap is discussed but few.
- so the issue is not liability as in “we can sue you”. It’s liability as in “provide a
fix for this (now!!!)”.
- the provider of the fix does not have to be the original developer who provides the fix
- this leaves open a possibility of ecosystems of developers in similar areas
Able to cross-work
- but if we have a world where everyone can write (maybe not well) then all code can be
“locally artisnally produced”
- so what is the great value of the big tech giants?
Buying a specific new software for a new need - thats work for hire. Liability can be done
but also payment upfront
Using software “just left lying around”. Well yeah. It can have vulnerabilities. But boy,
compare that to the shitshownif Fox News tried to write its own web server to publish its
own stuff.

New sensors allow new data industries

The ad twrgetting industry is just one
Most people are judging the value they get from smarphones,
amaozn delivieries and music back car alogies are worth the loss
of privacy.  they are mostly right because the consequences
of privaxy loss are lomited mostly to being served adverts.
the other feared consequences - loss of medical
cover, rediced access to financial services, insurance 
reduction and so on, are either heavily refulated
and bu fiat all people must bear the insurance cost (flooding a common exmaple)
or thise consequences are not widespread 
But we need to consider imapcts 
Others:
- roads will become the most heaviky monitored and 
imaged parts of human built areas - globally accurate milimetre perfect 
mapping of urban areas will be available. 
and extneding out from that is a matter of photo-grammetry.
At some point conveyancing will be transformed - i remeber a weeks delay in my forst house purchase 
when there was a half inch dosrepancy in council road plans 
twenty years apart.  I was less concerned about half an inch till it was pointed out that 
i might find my self unable to cross fromnthe public highway to mynown drivewaybwithout crossing a half inchnof someone elses land
it all was sorted out but any Tesla dricingndown the road would have mapped the keeb precisely
and kept photos.  
Is that Teslas property? is is a community service?

crypto solving wrong problem:
banks solving scale problem - 
but crypto can solve that by tracking movement of
money more efdectively in ledger
but crypto sovokg wrong problem - its not moving money but 
being abke to rescind chnage alter mistakes and dosagreements 
banks should be human scale so the problems resolved more easily
but also algorithmic to aboid biases

We talk about mechanisation of military (cavalry -> oil based transport)
also mechanisationnof society
but we need to talk about cyber security of society
see drones and area radio deniability (drones and remote control)
just as each radio must have encruotion and frwquency cycling
and somehow keep that going day after day so every radio has it
ie that old transport plane needs upgrading
so must we donsame for hardware supply chain
and software supply chain
and look at ransomare - that has social implicatiosn and the answer is basically upgrading
tech
- and there will be w freerider benefot

Topless computing
=================

(June 2007)
Not nearly as much fun as it sounds
===================================

The other day I was asked by a member of staff if it would be possible to tie
the holiday spreadsheet into the master workplanner application.
Now *possible* is a horrible word for IT people, because it is *always*
possible.  Its really a question of is it a good idea.
I said, well, not until the holiday recording was taken out of spreadsheet form
and put into something that was less ... topless.
Yes, I got the eyebrow reaction.
However it does make sense.  We do not know what the future is going to hold, so
it is always sensible to put our data and code into a form that makes it easy /
simple / feasible to build another system on top of it.
In other words we should build our systems to be **top-less**.
Of course, like in the real world, there are varying degrees of topless.  A
spreadsheet is possible to extract data from.  Perhaps I could write a
Python-server that looked at Excel at one end and spat out HTML / JSON the
other. But then I need to map employeeIDs between excel and this other thing,
and write some interpreter for the weird way the spreadsheet deals with time,
and it would probably be a good idea to cache the dates for speed, which means a
storage engine, and by this time I have written yet another half-assed
application, that still does not handle half-days sick, nor talk to the payroll,
nor know anything about regulations.
But to get rid of it will mean *me* going off finding a list of decent payroll
applications, and asking if they are topless.
Which always makes for a fun phone call.
To me **topless computing** is really, truly **user-friendly** software.  But by
that I assume there are computer literate users being considered.  Because
user-friendly does not mean it has a nice UI, it does not mean it has predictive
text.  It means that when I want to extend it, it does not get in the way.
(Some describe this as difference between *plumbing* and *porcelain*).
If all users could write source code, all programs would be topless. Or at least
have easy to remove bikinis. [#]_ And that is ultimately why I go around talking
about topless computing.
Because it sounds naughty.
European topless computing directive - the idea that this accessibility needs to
be enforced as a competitive need. Owning up banking like PSD2

substrate accessible and open - thinknautomatic cars
The idiot test
--------------


Elon Musk.
Challenging statements if you have written docs on how to oerform a task (ie
wiki not a bash script) you are not only idoot (bash is much "better") but you
have missed the fundamental paradigm - the written down bit is the bash scrip
(plus some nice comments !) comments, face to face contact, expeirence these
inform *context* which matters when parsing
* testable organisation - External to team is owned automateabke testing
milestones -> probably fitness style or cucumber style but the point is some
form of policy that is enforced by engine
Arranging the world to be iterated over.
----------------------------------------

  (joke about google destroying what it cannot index) BUt this is also true - we
did lose pre-industrial society. Lessons about how to live togetehr were lost
(beware rose coloured glasses and abuse) Historical sweep important, industrial
world only 250 years old, (1776 story). We have lost freedoms and gained a new
world - but it is unstoppable. We live in unsustainable world and our only hope
is onwards.  Software helps organise at scale - but *trust* matters. Organise at
scale, but organise openly to encourage trust, esp when it gets difficult. Yes
the system is rigged (Trump debate, darkness by design, but mortgage redlines
and martgage credit ratings, the need to type in "do crime" in VW code).
Software is the system, so you can read the rules.  If the rules are "chinese
communist party is in charge" then its harder, but humans value fairness beyond
almost all (monkey experiment)
