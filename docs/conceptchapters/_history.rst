History Of Software
===================

Software as we understadn it is a very young discipline, and even though I argue it is a form of literacy it is a very new form of literacy.

Alan Turing is credited 
Jacaqrd loom earliest perhaps.
Different technologies drives different software 'capabilities' - what can be expressed, not expression itself.

I think this is analsous to science fiction writing.
Shakespeare used fairies because aliens were not a well understood concept to his audience.  And rembmer tha software is both expressing ententions to a computer / compiler, it is also (equally? More so?) expressing intentions to the human reader (who needs to agree or understand and partner with the work)
