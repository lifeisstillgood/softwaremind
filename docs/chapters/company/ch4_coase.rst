New firm

Programmable company:

* the entirity of business is in code. Not in the middle management,
  not in "how we do things"

We can see Apple Run book / operations managemet as the earlu step in this world
But a completely what-if, flexible company will be anle to turn on a dime.

But this will come at costs - humans dont do well and need ther sort of explanation and mission and feed into decision making

Imagine everyone having their own engaged model of the company (ciuntry) and arging which is best format.  May never decide? or may just go with flow?

Excellent take on coase minimum 

So in modern world the process is thenthings - a single slip up causes horro - something a s project mange I know too well.  Approvals ...

And so what is needed is solutions to this - continuous integration is tried - but this is fixing things after they gone wrong - just really quickly after they go wrong

Apples vaunted process is to model the process correctly first

And this is my argument for the new company - the programmable company is one where all the interactions are programmed and viable in pre-production allowing choice, optimisationand modelling
