Global companies exist
netflix cannot sustain its global streaming position with just N American revenues - it's too big.  Apple iphone is probably same way

But it could slim down - you do not have to have a single streamer - why not use torrents? locally cached shows even by your neighbours? well who pays? is there a mechanism to honour payment or to handle other DRM? 

so this is about all those other industries that just flow against natural common sense
