The programmable company
=================================

We have covered some ground so its worth a recap

There is a great movie moment in
the film "The rainmaker" where matt Damon
has found the incriminating extra paragrpahs of 
the dodgy insurance companies policy manual, 
and he makes Roy Schneider read out the 
but where the insurance company wont pay out 
unless they get a solicitors letter, this rejecting 
anyone not "lawyering up"

Today such dramtic moments would be ruined 
by reading out Java code.  

But the point woukd be that someone had to write
the dodgy policy manual, ans someone would have to 
write the dodgy Java code.

Now an interesting thought experiment woukd be 
"what if there was a differnce between the policy manual
and the code?" which one sends Roy Schneider to jail?

As software eats the world, my conjecture is that it is
yiurbdaily practise not your avowed intentions that will send you tonjail
(imagine a world where the isnurance GUI sends out refusal letters while the policy manual says "we always treat our customerrs fairly)

so we can say "the code is the design" as the previous chapter argues

Now heres another question. If Roy schneider can read English
but cannot read Java code, is he immune from prosecution?
No. but perhaos equally he shoukdnnot be the CEO.

A programmable comapnynisnone whose activites are 
primarily driven and decided by ore-writtensoftware
- from daybto day tactical, tomooerational and even strateguc

Now huge number if companies have day to day work
controlled by aoftware - frommobvious high speed traders 
and pretty much every hedge fund, to utilities like power and sewage companies

but more and more are tranistioning as 
it makes verification eaiset - for example there is a gorwing class of smart 
wrenches - it knows where it is on the assemly and will 
recird that the user tightened three times to X newtons.
somethig that is useful for operational and for liability concerns

software will tell us what to do, and record if we have done it 
(the field to factory model of industrial chnages)

but the point it more and more of a company is innansoftware feedbackmloop 
and in oore and more industries

more companies are becoming programmable 
innpart and in whole.

And accessing that data and controlling the decisions 
is management . "inused to but now am manager means you are 
roy schniwdrr / or company is not yet progrmamble - which means your competitrs will 



* I used to write English but now I am a manager I don't anymore
* Feudal management (the link to Totalitarian Bet)
* competion dont work - the too big to fail is like wealthy individuals -
  fincical gravity pulls the playing field in their favour.
  Large companies empoyee more fair share people, are notoriously inefficient,
  and focus on Iron Laws beureacrtacy, 
* The feudal management ceiling - too much infomration for any human to take on
  leads to "The Economist" decision making disease.
* Trusted advisors from below become subsumed in internal politics of
  organisation
* but the Feudal maangement ceiling can be raised, by software enabled
  transmission, models and OODA decision making.
* OODA loop and the decision making process, and how software eats that
* RObotics and robotic company, or more informed decision makers
