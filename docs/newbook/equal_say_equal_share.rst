Equal Say, Equal Share
----------------------

The point is FDR was a traitor to his class.  And that he understood something that is rarely accepted in political circles.  An equal say means an equal share.  And if the answer is 'the plebs only get a say once every four years and the elite get a say every day, look at what explicit implicit and openness directionality means.  There is only so long people can put up with Dark Pools - isnt there?
