How to think about software issues
==================================

These are shorter discussions - but valuable, in trying to frame what
is and is not important in a new software literate, programmable
company and society.


The programmable company
------------------------

HR issue and wiring around it

I see busines management as a feedback loop of monitor, model, mentor.  And so given that we are trying to build a company that has software at its core operations (devmanual) we are sure we are not going to leave the management of the company to humans - no siree, what would our robot overlords have to say


Seeing monitoring being a real growing area - getting data from and about company actions. Google SRE etc

But modelling is rarer - and especially at strategic level, where whole company is modelled as a system.

Mentoring - using levers in the company to complete the feedback loop 

So the areas which our programmable company needs to have is 

This is where MOOP comes in for mentoring and behavioural change.

And yes god this could be some dystopian nightmare. Or it could be for our own good.

This is where it's about values and principles.  The difference between the chinese social credit system and this is really how much do you trust the beijing administration? And the answer is on the same order as trusting Washington, Downing st or elysee palace.  We have to have new institutions to help this - but mostly we need openness and transparency - double down on democracy 

Future of retail
----------------
Instagram - you can find the pots you like by following people and youtube does same - see it in action

So people putting them up can have affiliate links? is that the future? 


Project Management - death of 
=============================

There are about three kinds of activity that are routinely labelled as
"project management" in todays large enterprises.  They are
surprisingly not what the Institute of Project Management think is
project management, so I am going with my anec-data approach (as
usual).

FIrstly we have the "fuuuuuuck sort that out" project management.
This is the sort of thing young thrusting corporate ladder climbers
tend to get involved with - a situation has arisen in the enterprise,
and finally been noticed by the powers that be.  And its not good.
Usually some planned project is failing (see next type as well) or a
new opportunity arises that needs something doing *now*.

So people pile in, lots of shouting and planning and meetings and
slowly some consensus emrges on what needs to happen, the right data
is found, then discarded and replaced and metrics are measured and
suddenly a plan emerges.  Its funded, its going to work, all is well.

Now you can hand off the boring execution to the second type of PM,
while you move on to the next hair on fire problem.


The second type is follow the golden path (yellow bricks).  This consists
mostly of asking people is it done yet?  This is sort of helpful because the people doing the
work are usually so overworked and under-tooled that tracking their own effort / progress and
reporting on it is a significant extra effort - 105 is usually quoted and who can lose a day each fortnight to admin? So bring in someone else to do that admin - and the reporting.

It should be seen as a typing pool - and likely to vanish just as quickly in the mid 60s

But as common as these two seem they are kissing cousins.  FInding a plan (usuallyh by talking to the people doing the work) and following a plan are very replaceable.  The admin side of project management should be entirely replaceable by following the *digital footprint* of the coal face workers.

And creating a golden path plan, hardly counts as rockert science.

No project management is similar to architecture 0 it is often a sales job at higher management

Third type - Risk management.
Engineering. Seeing what is coming next. Avoiding the storm by arriving a day late.
Its unglamourous and hard to appreciate or sell.

Upper Management and effective resource allocation
==================================================

1. interest swaps.  Not good resource allocation but good at the level
of a billionaire needing for find some juice.

2. This is bad resource allocation - because they cannot find projects worth the return internally?

3. I call BS.

4. So this is to do with decision making at scale.  I dont think it is possible.

5. So democracy and voting.


MOOP, Agents and Happiness
===========================

* economic benefit is measured either pure energy efficnency (fire / chimney) or
  as percevied benefit (the high speed train). But it is always *human* benefit.

* but oerceived benefit is going to be a big winner - happiness

* middle aged now so a lot of the basic wins I am regretting are easy budge stuff.

* We are massivvely monitored. THis is the proivacy debate.  but I give up my privacy to lawyers, accountants and definitely doctors.  But I can imaginge handing over my car footage to lawyers and my spending patterns to accountants and every movement tracker to doctors.  I can *trust* them.

I cannot trust google.

How can we fix that

Personal control of personal data.
Better regulation of personal data (actually better punishment. GDPR is good)
But ultimately I want the benefits of being moniotred

So we need to build data ethics - the simple answer is the best interests of the user

THis starts to translate to other areas as well
EU Payments directive -> but that leads to why the fuck are financial services actually explouting me soooo much.  WHy is there not a default bank account that just saves 10% in index trackers from day one unless you sign out each day on a piece of paper in a basement.

Why is the default not in my best interests?

Leads to agents who can choose my best interest - it does not need massive socialist regulation - it can be done with paternalistic agents.  Which frankly is what a robo-advisor is anyway.

SO likely to see regulation of and certification of robo-advisors and open source driven versions, or crowd-configured versions as the highest performing.

So if your finances, shopping and groceries are selected for you as a default - what the hell are we worried about?


Distributed computing and Big Data
==================================

(see that migration from x to storing data around the servers)

Cloud and DevOps
================

Distributed computing is great.
What is less great is the failures increase.
The promise is totally failure free - but reality is failures occur and need to
be managed.

DevOps, especially the "indiana jones crossing the street" style, is
vital - and it tends to look like massive amounts of moniotring and
logging with tiny amount of simple distributed code.

The base concepts here are simple and easy.

But only on massive scale can the nearly-downtime free be found - so either you rely on a provider to do it (ie AWS) or you need to group as industries to supply this service (possible developemnt0

Dilbert
=======
problem is in not only is dilberts boss an idiot but so is his boss - in Scott Adams words "It's turtles all the way up"

but I don't believe that

People don't act the way they do because they are idiots - they act because of available skills and a system of incentives

and changing the fundamental skill (literacy) changes the set of incentives (a programmable company is something you can use)

Permission to get a little obsessed
===================================

It's about being better than our yesterday selves
https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/cool-tools/id605920446?i=1000440253165

it's about taking the time to better us so that we are a better example to our kids - time and something to impart

go be yourself - just like Indid

it's why process matters, why finding the essence matters - why mise en place matters - why not pretending you know what the plan is.

The solution to corporate world - GAR - when is solving this green when amber and when red. 

And solve the hardest parts first - and the hardest part is usually the rope bridge - all the way across the busies s value


Paxos and brexit and journalism
--------------------------------

One of our changes is that it's so much harder to be sure what has been agreed - consensus is often accepting what "everyone else" agrees - but finding our what everyone thinks used to be the job of the journalist, (reporting) but now social
media has made it so hard to find commonality

this goes into expert problem - when experts agree they have a mechanism to agree - medical trials / p values 

but that flies in face of common sense - unlearned by science

we all become scientists? but then we just have same problem of not investigating it sufficiently 

we have mass movement (climate change)
approach - enough david attenborough docs and it wins

still
leaves negotiating for the actual action 



Ping Pong Pair Programming
==========================

Pair Programming is OK as a means of mentoring or teaching - but as a means of an existing competent programmer journeying it is ... awkward.   I have found ping pong to be far more useful - a short time period of work in close proximity (even remote video) and a fixed goal with lots of integration- so I write the tests you write the code or I write the API you write the client and we swap / integrate into a CI every half hour or hour



Agile
=====

Hugely popular, probably most misunderstood idea in current methodology.

Issues

* really good developers and teams are really good with *any* methodology
* any half sane methodology consistently applied can raise the floor, and thus raise productivity dramtically (not causing drag)
* Any methodology that can remove project managers (middle management) will
  improve average productivity because the value provided is so small
* MIS can be entirely extrcted from code / tickets.
* It follows that a vital part of agile is thus change control
* change control is 'what did we plan to do, what did we do and what is the difference', forward looking (what are we planning to do now) and risk based (what are the risks in what we are planning)

Thus the most important part of agile is to replace middle management with tiny amounts of effort on the developer (coal face) part.  Think the disappearance of the typing pool - maangers expected to type for themselves because its just sooo much cheaper.

(CF end of project managers)
