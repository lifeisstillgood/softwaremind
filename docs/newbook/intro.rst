Chapter: Neurodivergence
========================
chaoter: neurodivegence and coding, ADHD racing thoughts, constant interrupting people and conversations



Chapter: Software Literacy
===============================
Literacy is fundamentally Explicit, Introspectable and tends towards Open

The next few decades or more will belong to software literate the way the past
few centuries belonged to those who could read and write.  

* the software literate company (what WaPo looks to a
medieivle scrptorem) (literate best practise / the dev manual)

* The programmable company - splitting up working in the company and on the
company. Change control etc etc.
We dont need managers, we need editors.
OODA loop and testing and modelling and preproduction

* Policy, process, control - Deep state, introspection, software governance
  Heading towards democracys
  TOtalitarian bet on programmable company, and the democratic bet

* coders are new managers

* AI tomorrow, software todays

* disaggregating mgmt

* journalism and training data



Chapter: The programmable company
=================================

* I used to write English but now I am a manager I don't anymore
* Feudal management (the link to Totalitarian Bet)
* competion dont work - the too big to fail is like wealthy individuals -
  fincical gravity pulls the playing field in their favour.
  Large companies empoyee more fair share people, are notoriously inefficient,
  and focus on Iron Laws beureacrtacy, 
* The feudal management ceiling - too much infomration for any human to take on
  leads to "The Economist" decision making disease.
* Trusted advisors from below become subsumed in internal politics of
  organisation
* but the Feudal maangement ceiling can be raised, by software enabled
  transmission, models and OODA decision making.
* OODA loop and the decision making process, and how software eats that
* RObotics and robotic company, or more informed decision makers




Chapter: Literary Best practise
===============================
Software demands different best practises
We are finding them - and what it will look like makes WaPo different to a
medieval scriptoreum.
Prod-Parallel and back testing, 
Tool use
COmmon solutions (octavio, editing)
THis is The DevManual

To "manage" you need to have an OODA loop.
To "release with confidence" you need to have a prod-parallel env / test rig.
To "plan" you need to have failing tests in the prod-parallel env, that are like
bug bounties for employees.  DO not fall for capitalism here, use socialism
inside the org.

Chapter OODA loop and production ready, tech debt.
==================================================

Observe, Orientate, Decide, Act.

This is operating *on* an existing system. We are managing the system.
If we cannot get metrics from the system, we cannot observe
If we do not have a (software) model of the system we cannot orientate,
(use of Statitical process control)
Deciding is politics - persuasion, allocation of resources, collection of
resources.  
Act is development 

The main issue is we have *assumed* the model is in the managers head, or 
in their holy spreadsheet.  Possibly because the numbers in the sheet are
'dangerous' to pass around.

But with software metrics, thats a choice not a requirement. A model can be 
"soft real time" updated, and the VAR number calculated each day.

Deciding is affected to, as differnet costly options can be appplied to model
and prod-parallel for analysis.  

And Act is the art of filling in the red failing tests in the prod-parallel.


Chapter: FOSS and capitalism. Its really a fight.
=================================================
todo

Chapter: engineering is experimental more than theoretical
===========================================================
bridge buiktnin 1846 rail bridgr twisted
not until extra load added and twosted
point is nowadays we have mich more modelling of behaviour
but we dont model the software emgeering - thisnis something we shoukd od and will have to do - tomincreas reliability as well as improve reactions 
esp if we get to poijt where others can does that change kiability issues 




#### expand below
A better test rig is orders magnitude more effective than “better communication”
Once a complete prod-parallel environment exists, any management question is answerable directly through exploratory code chnage.

Major chnages (1.x 2.x) can presumably use the same real life feed, see Tesla data advantage.

see Brooks law.

that management is disaggregated and the communication 
value is much much lower 


also primary skill set is learning 
that is the provle we have is one we have never seen before
in this configuretion
so gonaway learn prqxtise and then come back and fix
its not a 9-5 job - its a consuktancy 
so the idea of agile or management or bums on seats is ... off - end of industrialisation (see my favourite door in London, and the need for knowledge workers, like lawyers)


Other management issues
model monitor mentor, internal homestasis of org, whilst meeting external 
needs - politics of status quo and guesstimate changes.

If the communication is gone, if model monitor are better done by software, of process is better done by software, then what we have left is internal homeostasis
Or politics (which will be disrupted by democracy as feudal politics was disrupted - and its the middle class that rebel always)

Mentoring becomes a profession - a profession that is impossible to hold back to a few
It’s a fiat chance that we will find lawyer like prosfessions where they will have a commit bit for the big software - laws, the software for gov depts

What will it look like?
Newsroom of WaPo- managers become editors as it becomes possible to manage a company through code 

Chapter: 21C knowledge workers, 19C practises
=============================================
Chapter: new work organisation - not your 9-5, digital footprints, not planning
forward but auditing backwards, test not trust (ie automated testing not "trust
delegated people will fit it in somehow"


Chapter: policy, process, control
==================================
 
  Software can / does make policy explicit.
  4 quadrant area about DODGY / COMPLEX - INTEGRITY / SIMPLICITY
  SIMPLE / DODGY = Crime (ie LIBOR)
  SIMPLE / INTEGRITY = high performance, high profit, 
  COMPLEX / INTEGRITY = healthcare, space travel,military weapons
  COMPLEX / DODGY = FInancial engineering, 

  implements process
  enforces policy
  Is instantly introspectable
  Careful issues around deep state
  THe quadrant shows the reluctance toallow software and regulation in
  Introspection allows people to ask questions, which in DODGY areas is 
  a problem.  And it allows outsiders to see how sausage is made.

Chapter: If AI can replace your job tomorrow, Plain old software can today
==========================================================================

  AI is not magic, it simply tries to solve the robotics issues
  - what is the perception of the real world
  - what is the model of the real world
  - what is the perception of my situaiton in the world
  - what is the next action 

  (OODA)

  But AI is able to *build* a model in a amazing new way,
  but a model of the world is not useful without perception of 
  world and own ability.

  So if AI can build some model of a "perfect manager brain", 
  it will still need to be fed perceptions of the operations daily 
  ANd are those already being fed upwards - honestly turns out mostly no.
  THey are stuck in siloes, they are filter through powerpoint presrntations
  and massaged by project managers, 

  AI can learn to balance a ball on a stick.  But if we have unclear
  information about where the ball is, how the stick is moving etc,
  it will perform at least as badly as 

  The perception feedback must be good for any model to be transferrable.
  If it is bad then how do we behave - the same way most managers behave - 
  find a few trusted lieutenants who can find *just enough* information 
  to be representative and keep churning and find that playing politics in
  feudal environment is almost always more profitable than fixing the
  perceptiin and action problems.

  AI is not magic. if you think some or all of job can be repaced by AI
  then the question is, why cant it be repaced today woth traditional software
  its not volume of data - no human can compete
  its access to tools and ots decision politics
  if AI can replace a manager tomorrow then software can do it today 

Chapter: What does the organisation of tomorrow look like
===========================================================

  LIES / TRUTH / UNFILTERED/FILTERED PERCEPTION

  Totalitarina bet, Wealth inequality, feudal society, 
  property owning middle class, 

  We are approcahing the slow down of the s-curve of the industrial
  revolution.  Energy was the *whole ball game* and it allowed a unique
  period of time where equality changed (see Pikkety)
  Now the wealth / power elites want to reassert themselves. 
  Its a issue of deomraccy - equal say implies equal share.
  but democracy also has a societal benefit - the Totalitarian Bet.

  The property owning Middle class (unable to live on its own assets but have
  sufficeint assest to cushion lifetimes of blows, hence social insurance
  increases the middle class by minimising knick out blows)

  (this is the problem with UBI - Rome had UBI where the people with the 
  wealth handed out daily stipends in return for loyalty.)


Chapter: Coders are the new managers, CPUs are the new workers
================================================================

  - THoery of firm / how organisations will change
  - Coders are the new managers, CPUs are the new workers (as almost every job has co-pilot or enabled by software / robot / machine)
  
Chapter: Editors as managers, Test harnesses as ... 
======================================================


Why have a 9-5 culture? Why sprint? Is that the right way to run reporting
What about the long term approach - stringers and ... 
# 2_orders_of_magnitude


Chapter: software is disaggeegating management 
===============================================

  - how do companies decide? 
    robotics useful 
    simple terms - OODA loop 
    observe is perception - collection of data
    orient is collating data into a model that 
    is an effective representation of reality 
    decide is choices based on model, model predictions plus politics
    Act is chnage the code and release 

    how does this help us - it goves model for how
    programmable company can work - we are seeing software eat
    the world at the observe stage - but rarely do we see a whole org
    model that is ontegrated into thise 

    AI is sorta hoped / worried it will do this second stage (and DAnd A)
    but explicitly calling itnout its clear one can easily domit
    but it challenges the existence of feudal
mgmt elite that "understands" the company

    cf VAR - "get me one single number to judge company bu"
    ok but once we do, anyone can judge it - that model is built
    it is available

    counterpojt - there are too mmay variables we have to do this by feel
    yeah bollocks


  - THoery of firm / how organisations will change
  - Coders are the new managers, CPUs are the new workers (as almost every job has co-pilot or enabled by software / robot / machine)
  
Chapter: Journalism is labelling the training data for the world
=================================================================
  * LLMs, AI, journalism
  Training data matters 

chapter:The Totalitarian Bet, The democratic bet and wealth taxes
=================================================================
* totalitarian bet
  
lo-code is rubbish but learnign curve huge
developer tools are really litersacy tools
software will not only control the companies we work in (policy enforcement snd impenetaiotn) but will shape how we cahnge said policies - through democracy and
through modelling - policits exists but will shift to more open and more model driven.
We hope - thsts the totalitarian bet

chapter:Feudalism, Democracy, Wealth Tax
========================================

* democracy in companyes as orgnsityiona change
  Why should those employees control those - but they already do, it’s just internal politics, bribery 

politics will not end, but democracy will change politics of elite in and out of orgs

Jp Morgan was a democratising force just like FDR using the mass of people to push aside old feudal elites (and make new ones natch)



Chapter: MMT, Crypto, Equality, Democracy
=========================================

class war: https://billmitchell.org/blog/?p=61635
chapter - MMT, class war, wealth tax, crypto
my take is MMt is right about basics
that itnis about abolity tonput reaources if a nation / society to bear 
Notth korea has one approach
the state droven is another (soviet)
Capitalism is another - elite driven
but democracy is another 
democracy and capitalism are not synonymous 

dutch in 1700s used financial methods to align 
resources - as did banknof england

its leas clear where and how thise resources can be directed 
financially - esp when much finance is derivative
or betting on other outcomes instead of focused on 
using resources

how do we use resources - fiat crypto will likely end 
banks ability to create money sonwill affect ability for koneybcrwation to reflect 
real reaiurces

so what will? whomwill dorect more nurses 

- equality and infrastructure  is the issue. if we were all equal, all capital holders, all labour and all consumers 
then infrasturcutre would drive agglomeration - or rather itnwould be easier to move cities due to 
climate chnage - or would it - the built environment? 


The DevManual - SaaS is dead, because IFTT is rubbish
=====================================================

We want to own our own data
Dont put state into the queue system
Dont have the configuration spread over dozens of apps. Or rather microservices
should not look different from the config lens... or rather having all the
config look different so diff dependancies are runnign same is ... really
awkward.


* 2 orders magnitude conjecture - that forms will divide up like this ??  
 - The Economist presents a simplified model of every issue.  But it is possible that every prod-parallel env can supply a model (ie the model that SEC holds fed every minute about traders) 
 
chapter: Conclusion
====================
TBD
