    "Software is eating the world".
    Marc Andreessen
    
You see, Software is a new form of *literacy*.  Just imagine
what literacy did to every walk of human life as it spread. The world
of Medieval Monks in Scriptoreums had embedded in it newspapers, bus
timetables, ballot papers and user manuals, but you try predicting
that from a bunch of bald-headed guys holding feathers.  

It is this books assertion that *Software Literacy* is as deep and as
profound as reading and writing, and will have impacts as long-lasting
on the human race (assuming we all make it that far!).  And some people
get it - and some people don't.  So this book is an attempt to try and
persuade some of the don't side that really this is important. 

Main Thenes
-----------

What can we learn from 20 years of web and internet to help frame the engineering problems of the next 20 - that is what can politics Keane?

The issues seem to be standards and openness versus 

Summary

- good engineering makes us all better and safer
- this stems from a desire to do it right 
- and a conducive political environment  (or at least a clear and consistent one)
- teams, companies will all chnage
- democracy is still young - and we need to help it grow,
- look in my works yes mighty and despair


Also the software hierarchy

External politics
(Osmotic membrane)
Internal organisation politics

Team dynamics

Architectural decisions

Technical possibilities 

Each layer imposes its costs - for new companies there have been no decisions yet so few costs (except as dimly felt through the policlal membrame)  but as they make decisions it forms up

But always follow the money
Explanation for trump
See pikkety and bottom 50% of America have seen no real term growth in income since 1980

That's all you need to know for why trump
And a lot of other issues 

Book Sections
-------------

The first will discuss *Software Literacy* and its impact on
organisations and economy.  We will look at the shape of literate
organisations now, and how far short they fall of obvious ideals.

Privacy and individual comes next. Touching on law etc.
politics, Globalisation, Nations, democracy, equality, Paxos, Bitcoin, my partisantinship, 5% GDP
Transaprency

The grain of the internet, and the grain of literacy.
(includes algorithms and fitness functions)

Security. Always Security.



The basics

Software surfaces trade offs explicitly
The moral issues over canoes and crocodiles
Now encoded in software - who to kill the kid crossing the road or the car occupant?

Will you buy that car? No so the market cannot be trusted to do what we think as a society is moral

So we do need regulation. We regulate murder.

As software eats the world it needs to deal with the world's decisions

The process of delivering software needs to reflect the process of delivering law - more discussion and democracy

The themes and ideas fit in a framework of economic and philosophic analysis that I lay out and discus

And the dev manual is how to implant that in your company 



Pikkety and yes prime minister explain how nothing has improved in thirty years
Plus my inflation anecdsta - explains Brexit

Nordbat2 and Bosnia - mission command and the importance of mission and the dead hand of regulation


The need for a software engineer profession
Something akin to railway engineer - sign it off or no go.
This person is - hard to explain, kind of like a RSM. In theory the Colonel can order RSM about, but in a genuine conflict between the two the outcome would be uncertain - no bad example

Companies - we don't live in a free market
