What's wrong g with bitcoin
----------------------------

First what's right :  crypto ledger
second - open protocol


0. It has no underlying cash flow - 
0. it's not a currency

0. The idea was for every computer to run a few extra cycles for the mining - decentralised mining.  What we have are vast (Chinese) farms

0. As a currency it's run by china (strategic issue)

0. Mostly it's about evading chinese currency controls

0. What's wrong with efficiency - transaction proof 

0. what's wrong with trust? We like analogue trust - it works and we know how to manage it.  Yes con artists get around it, yes we trust wrong people - but competition and openness do fix most of those issues.  We are looking to technology to fix a human scale problem of politics - be open, be equal, ensure competence and accountability  - this is hard we all want unfairness 

abut what's wrong

The people who buy it - basically richer trump
voters - people in the golf bar who believe some consurpiacy theories - also don't trust the government - it's just ... icky 



1. Skewed distribution 
idea is 21 million coins represents all the economy - world economy if something like 100 Trillion - 13 Tn trade and rest infra country, real estate etc

So if satori owns first million coins - he has roughly 20 trillion -  among him the worlds second largest country by GDP - which is fairly fucking stupid.  Imagine the G20 meeting where he announces his plans to buy an aircraft  carrier and - oh fuck it that's never going to happen - it's not a curren y 

Look it started as a cool hack and became a darling of a certain kind of anti government idea, and the idea of crypto currency is a good one -  it right now it's a means of avoiding currency controls in china.  

(imagine a single economy with one car toy making one product - all the output of the factory would need to be purchased so there would need to be enough currency to equally the economic output) 

Electricity usage

anonymous - tracking drug deals, tracking meta data at all

price is too high - and electrical use per transaction per block is too high 

So it's a replacement for swift? Every disruptive use just hits a "why bother with prooof of work" question.
