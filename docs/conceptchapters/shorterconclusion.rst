Putting the conclusion before the horse.
========================================

   Litracy
   
   Attitude

   Companies will need to change - society needs to have more software
   loterate people, and need to change to make those people productive
   (infrastructure as code, *business* as code)

   The Great Rewrite (just like factories). Its not really there
   because code is still ... typing pool.  Saas is basically
   outsourcing your typing pool and Zapier / IFTT is drag and drop
   programming (we dont do drag and drop novel writing why the hell do
   you think it will work for code).

   Programmable companies
   
   My conjectures:

      programmable company
      
      measuring more - that is software commits will link to expected
      changes in measurements inside the company
      So you can see if your code change has an effect.
      this will be so powerful that smaller companies, or other firebreaks
      will exist just to avoid confounding issues
      The simplest idea is jira, but this is basically a recipie for AI enabled
      companies

      democracy
      Managing change and managing risk
      leads to governance - leads to democracy
      Literacte people demand control - see lawyers.
      Piketty / coase and thoery of the firm
      

      Regtulation in age of transparency - the transaprent business
      model leads to *fairer* outcomes.  Its waay harder to hide your
      biases if you have to encode them and waay waay harder when you
      have to publish the code.

      cf - education in grammar schools and in Kathy book.
      Sears catalog and African Americans
      
      This leads to the democracy double down: we lean into what works
      Techniques to improve corporate governance will be transferrable to society - wardley maps, corporate democracy

      Reporting will become a zero marginal cost - but it is litmus
      test of programmable company.  How will reporting work as
      journalism when its a zero marginal cost? Where will commerical
      confidentiality be when we try to build a model of the economy -
      the Treasury wants this tries this but imagine there are better
      models out there - goolge earth zoom in.
      
   
   Transparency and Moops (back to training of graduates - its expensive and
   what really is the next step - we all learn calculus?)
   
   Making something vs taking a slice (Grenfell tower, Renting out facebook domain juice, google rentier)
   
   Just not getting it - Post office, and the knight trading people
   Where have we moved the complexity and the cost - every shady company is just a complexity / risk hiding. From crash to elsewhere managing risk and managing complexity are huge endemic - and we are doing it badly.

   Need software to manage it - to report on it, to pull it from virtual
   
   But also need transparency in business models, to manage risk in
   the benefit of user adn benefit of society.  Strainger regulation
   makes difference. More direct responsibility for a problem. Less
   wriggle room Alignment globally of regulatins
   
   Quatified lives (BIOTU)

   (Moop - social punishment of sending someone to electronic coventry - iphone says not to talk to that person)
   Moop and privcy
   solution to provacy sort of regulation, possibly market based
   but my preference is Best Interests Of the User. Medical.
   
   Forcing us to be clear about decisions - no hiding the risk, no
   hiding the impedance mismatch. Cultural colonialism is
   *simplifiying* !!!  How do we have an option for "illelgal"? - See
   VW they did it. But the code base is there !!!

   Company size - do one thing well? Is the value of giant company
   that it can find an expert? Isnt that the point of market? Is the
   value of giant compnay that it can absorb and mitigate? Isnt that
   insurance? See flood plains in UK Match speed of requirements
   change to speed of development/
   Multinationals should not be the means to mitigate and enforce standards
    - tht is supposed to be market?
    

   "The great Rewrite"
   literacy forces organisation level change - "the great rewrite".
   organisations will force social level change -
   and systemically vital organisations will need to be regulated
   globalisation will force regulation to be transparent and common.
   (WTO Darfour round)

   At the personal level MOOP is an exciting concept.  But so is having
   ability to code my bank statements.



The Software Mind - It's not a *philosophy*.  *Attitude* is
too... well actually attitude is pretty good. Yes, Attitude. The
Software Mind is an *attitude*.  It is an attitude formed from using,
writing and reading code day in and day out.  

Imagine you woke up this morning and found yourself back, say, 3000
years.  98% of the world was illiterate - had simply never picked up a
book.  Oh they had *heard* of books and thought people who could read
were very, impressive, and got good jobs, but no. Most people could
not read the headline on a newspaper.

Not that there were any newspapers.

Imagine your own *attitude* about this Brave New World.  Would you not
want to bring the benefits of reading and writing (and soap) to the
world? Would you not have a very peculiar *attitude* about how it
would be really useful to learn to read.  It would be attitude about
how a book should be arranged, with chapters and character arcs and
indexes.  And then an attitude about how *libraries* should be
arranged.  And an attitude then about, now we have these books, and
this body of knowledge that can help with medicine and geography and
such, about how companies should be arranged, and then how society
itself should be arranged. Written political manifestos! Medical journals.

You see the problem with this *attitude* is that it looks, from a
non-literate person's point of view, it looks very *uppity*. Having to
turn everything on its head just because its better from the point of
view of a *book*?  Sounds crazy.

Software Literacy is a real thing.  It is something we *all*, all
eight billion of us, should learn.  It is a thing that *demands* we
turn the world upside down just to realise the benefits of a software
literate world.  Because the last time we turned world upside down to
meet the needs of books, it turned out pretty well.

If I sound uppity throughout this book, there is a reason. 

Right let's have a gander through the rest of the book so we know what to
expect when we get there.

There is a famous snarky quote -

::

    We see the benefits of computers everywhere, at home, at work,
    except in the productivity statistics.
    -- Robert Solow
    (https://eml.berkeley.edu/~bhhall/e124/David90_dynamo.pdf)    


Its a fair comment.  Vast Multinational conglomerates spend vast sums
on technology - and yet seem to barely improve their bottom lines.  I mean
most of the Fortune 500 spend *billions* each per year on
"technology", and benefits accrue, yes, but half those benefits come
from being able to say no to expense account padding.

Its not because software is not useful - its just not used well.

<google relative performance issue.>

<add to conclusion>
Here is a little story.  Around the turn of the 20th Century mass
elecgtrification was taking place across the modern world.  Houses
were being lit, searchlights sent out Bat signals, and factories were
buying in to the new hotness. Factories had been arranged around a
central power source - the steam engine. Boilers and gears and belts
ran from one efficient engine, and turned, rolled and lifted equipment
in various dark corners.

The first wavve of electrification removed the big noisy engine, and
replaced it with a big, quiet electric engine. But left the belts and
power transmissions in place.  And no matter how hard they tried,
companies saw electricity everywhere, except in the productivity
statistics.

Eventually the promise of the electric motor, many, smaller
distributed around as wanted to benefit the factory process, became
the norm - Car companies like Ford lead the way to use electricity in
new decentralised ways, and popularised the Assembly Line.  Heavy
tools could now be placed next to banks of workers.

The factory had been desinged *in sympathy* with electricity.




I get why this is hard - look at universal education. Basically a post
grad in a hard science is a factory-produced renaissance woman.  After 25 years or so of  continuous education a Post-grad should be able to calculate the orbit
of the moon, and so on? Really this is an argument?

and
the UK produces about 50% graduates each year - we have built a
society trying to turn half its children into leonarso (and not the
cool one with a half shell and swords)

There is a corollary- caring professions are often labelled as such as
low salary - this is often blamed on misogyny or some other form of
prejudice but a simpler economic explanation is scarcity - and as we
improve software literacy we shall see a similar salary dip.



SRE - designing a ops team *in sympathy* with software.

A progrmmale company is what you get when you ask a developer to
design a company - what are the likely stand out features - best guess
is AB testing - (Agile, feature factories and measurable company products -
https://cutle.fish/blog/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory

The main thing is if we are measuring developer productivity- expected
vs actual, then every other decision maker should have the same
analysis

For example AB testing - example of graphite chart showing did my
change to funnel improve sales process.  but we could show similar
things for did the new marketing leaflet / branding change make an
impact? what about the offering two for one to under 30s or some other
demographic? constant experimentation means a constant willingness to
change - and having it in software makes it possible

)

And what do you get when you design a society with (software) literacy
at its core?  Perhaps evidence based politics? Double down on the winning
choices of past two hundred years - democracy, transaprency, rule of rules,

Two visions: Dystopia and Utopia visions - police state and free
state.  Alwatys a good idea to choose utopia.  I am going to assume
humans will choose the utopia option.  At least in one part of the
world.  And it is likely to spread.

DOubleDOwn - From Governance of COmpanies to Governance of countries
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Software is eating the world - its not done yet.  But it is now
"systemically important" and so will be regulated.  Software
governance will play a part as the 13th Factor


Transparency (trust vs measurement):
advantages of rogrammaboe company 
ability to swing from trust to metrics
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22269024

Problems
Need to be specific in your political promises !
This means smaller sizes are easier to trust.
The giant companies, and the giant countries, might just look a little less enticing. If the EU and achieve its goals - of building a giatn signle market that is as easy to spread across as say the Federal United states, then perhaps other giant political aggregations may not be needed. 

From a western perspective, double down on what works - what has
driven the past two hundred years.  Transparency, democracy (have
another go in 4 years), - more democractic companies - less
exploitation (ie credit card rates as exloitation) - trust built in -
the greatest trust is in Science, and medicine.  how to replicate
medicoen trust is to replicate "first do no harm" - the wwelfare of
individual patient is paramount at all times.  This is freaking hard.
Discuss smelleiss and the scottish surgeon.


- project management is dead. Programmable companies are
  programmable. They dont need project management they need software
  developemnet life cycles. THis is the real success of Agile.

Project mgmt - status tracking (free with digital footprints)

Project mgmt - deployment and rollouts and scaling (see SRE)

Project mgmt - defintion??


- clarity of incentives and neto work organisation - we can see the
politics of an org and the incentives

Transparency and metrics leads to MOOPS
----------------------------------------

- this will lead to early MOOPS - how to improve maangerial ineter
- personal comms FInally the capabiliteis good enough to lead to
- consumer use and psychologucal agents

- governance and simple and transaprent laws and code
  
- how we run companies will start to leak into how we run socieity
  - Wardley maps
  - models of economy and "our own facts"
  - fake news is just the shake out of "own facts"
  - 

- software and politics again is governace and shared osmosis

- coaseian dieal firm size - and regulations needed to change it (ie
  anti-trust laws allowing co-ordination)


- Trying to judge the essential and the incidental (prblems with
  pagerank, renting out your domain juice)

- software socualism and open source
  Open source seems most obvious
  Open hardware nash equlibrium
  Open source scandal like UK post office


- where have we moved the complexity - it is rare that we remove
complexity - we have it in people process or technology - and where we
choose to put it and manage it matters


- culture wars and Ok Boomer.  Brexit: trade agreements ante becoming
more aligning regulations, aligning culture.  Iphone is basically
starting it from the other side.


so the more our lives are represented in virtual the more we can
measure it and so harmonise it - so it's about being aware of the
importance and details of these dates - this is thus a good thing of
brexit


Debt and Snaller VC investments

iphone says is t talk to them / be - 



moop, life coach and life agency if beat intersts of patient is used
as the goal then if we stop selling you to advertisers we then start
selecting products based on best interests of the patient - in other
words legal requirements to agent says only do what's in best
interests of patient - so it becomes really hard to offer products
that are exploitative - we build a "name of that podcast paternalistic
something"

No where to hide differences
----------------------------
One culture to rule the world credit suisse issue - yes racism but
more importantly it's aristocracy not wanting to have problems on
their doorstep - and that's about differences in culture being
impossible to resolve without dealing with

for example today's multi national companies have to internally deal
with the problems - american bribery foreign act is impossible to use
in UsA we do business with saudi arabia in saudi normal practise - but
that's not acceptable in USA

so they deal with it by .... and then the differences come up in a garden fight 

but we cannot keep hiding it in large internal
company culture - it becomes coasian - smaller companies more explicit- 

it's like cities - eventually they find a way to set what is normal -
it tends to be unfriendly and formalised - but also accessible???
 
software enables hoice of cultural differences - like regulation you
need to have software compatible- like you have an option for
"bribery"


Company size - do one thing well
see Boeing - https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-coming-boeing-bailout

Coase - big enough to do one thing and do it well 
the
Data Socialism (yearning to be free, more accurately yearns to *flow*)
Pools of spreadsheets like sticks and rocks in a river, holding up the flow.

Data is communal and collective (google should be releasing it all for my access) - medical uses etc are best achieved communally

see also google traffic information 
(not same standards as enforcement - but that is not needed) 


There is really only one answer to this: you need to find a way to match the requirements-development-delivery cycle to the rate at which the requirements change. In the case of my government project, we did so artificially: there were no changes of any substance, so it was simple to build to the specification and acceptance test.https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/02/20/requirements-volatility-is-the-core-problem-of-software-engineering/


The Internet 2.0
----------------

Map of demographics and societal changes

Assumptions are that underlying democratic institutions matter wildly - 

but we are looking at changes outside of the land grabs virtual world - we are starting to see tectonic shifts in real world

facebook was so huge cos it had no competition - but online real estate faces offline real estate agents and regulations and change

- education will change - universities will change and have changed - in UK school
leaving age is now 21 - quality of education changes but so does the point of education - being in class is to meet other classmates (and drink and sleep with them partly) - see the MBA choices

There will be increase in such "opportunity makers" and again huge competition for the ones we're the other rich ones are going - leading to an obvious marketing option

- but there will be unbundling - yes college as we know it will be place to go - but lectures and learning are the excuse for drinking and figuring out you.

In my fathers era that was conscription - people from all walks of life were thrown together.

this is probably a good socially beneficial algorithm - randomise school intakes - much simpler if the education delivered is mostly online !

- Education 
- real estate (see the MMT etc lectures)
