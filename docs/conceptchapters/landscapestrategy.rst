Landscape and strategy
======================

 From Sun-Tzu we get five principles
- but generally three are ignored - landscape climate and doctrine - swardley views these as part of movement / mapping - and derived a viable competitor landscape
mapping technique 

easiest to start with and example

it is about viewing constant change on a map level - to see where opportunities lie


Now why is this important? 

Because of changing the business - as programmable
company becomes rea
the main value is in changing the strategic direction - and that getting that wrong will be so easy without maps of the territory


Maps vs Stories

Amazon seems to run on stories - no powerpoints but good communication

If I want to give you directions from A to B I can tell a story, right at the traffic lights, third left past the rose and crown.  Vikings navigated like that. But a map is better.  It takes a lot more skill (and maths) to draw a map (hence the young training of 17th C naval officers)

But what if the map was a better form of communication  - what if amazon can be beaten? 

What if the best case is a model (model monitor mentor) 


project management to risk management to having a map !!! 

kill off project mgmt
but risk
management is ok except .. without a map how do you even know what risks exist or which are the worst and even what actions will avoid them? 

It's called value chain mapping because it tries to be the same map across all parts of the business - where value is added - so competitor maps different in business to Netowrk / IT 

The landscape, climate and doctrine from sun-tau determine strategy and the ins and out Avery well

Doctrine - like a style guide or dev manual for developers

But the landscape of software is often seen as magic by the ore-literate
And it's why algorithms matter



So it's the two kinds of why - why this move instead of all the other moves possible. That means you need an understanding of all the possible moves and their future implications - why means a map.

Swardley evolution as a Wodehouse approach to building viable software - it cannot be perfect out the gate and this gives is a value based evolution for the service (soa microservice api approach)

Simple to complex roadmaps
==========================


Swardley??

One of the important things in software, perhaps the most important, is to keep things simple.
As the needs of an organisation grow, the complexity of the systems it uses increases.
I show here, in each section, a roadmap of complexity.  The base simplicity levels are
expected to give the fundamental understanding of the problems, but give way fgracefully to
new, (ope source) solutions that do the same thing as the simple system, but have extra more useful features.

FOr example, in configuration and co-ordination, we start with just a init file style API that reads from a text file
telling us what config data exists for our systems.  This is *fine* but it really quickly hits limits.
SOmething like APache Zookeeper is the next logical step, but that is waay more complicated to set up.
So we start witht he simplest possible, and point to where to take the next steps.
