The programmable company
=================================

Two things make a robot work. Perception and funding.



Companies are known as "corporatations".  THis is they are supposed to be
like a *human body*. Humans have near-continuous feedback from sensors
through out the body, providing the brain with uptodate ... oh you know
what a body is. 

And pretty much every harried executive knows that companies are nothing 
like that. None of them know where the next fire they have to fight is 
going to come from. Trying to get consistent infomration *that has not been
manually massaged and adjusted* is impossible.

We lack sensors to observe what is happening, lack pipes to transmit 
that information, lack a model of the operations to populate with the data, and
compare to an expected operation, and as for turning round and giving
instructions that will be carried out ... forget it.

Ok maybe there is a little bit of the Office in there, but all companies
large and medium suffer from most of these problems.  THe small ones are
easier to manage but tend to go bust.


If we were to treat the corporation as a robot.
But it is a self-repairing robot. A robot where the self reapiring mechanism 
is also trying to figure out how to make the robot more *its* way.  

So we want to split out our model

* a versioned company, running one version of the 'Company OS', using SOP, 
* a self-repair mechanims (change) that is fighting to acquire more of robot for
  itself
* many versions of data sensors, data pipes, operating model, SOP updates.
* a running version of the above version, in test rig, showing what will happen
  with certain changes.

THe self repair mechasnism can therefore be pointed at the test rig first,
and by having new versions play against recorded production, its possible to
backtest changes.

Oh and most companies are really lots of robots living togeher sharing a single
treasury.

This might get complicated.



AI is sweeping in now. It is being gifted almost magical powers to solve this
problem - but if AI can perhaps solve your issues, then you can solve them
anyway, today, with normal software. 


We have covered some ground so its worth a recap

There is a great movie moment in
the film "The rainmaker" where matt Damon
has found the incriminating extra paragrpahs of 
the dodgy insurance companies policy manual, 
and he makes Roy Schneider read out the 
but where the insurance company wont pay out 
unless they get a solicitors letter, this rejecting 
anyone not "lawyering up"

Today such dramtic moments would be ruined 
by reading out Java code.  

But the point woukd be that someone had to write
the dodgy policy manual, ans someone would have to 
write the dodgy Java code.

Now an interesting thought experiment woukd be 
"what if there was a differnce between the policy manual
and the code?" which one sends Roy Schneider to jail?

As software eats the world, my conjecture is that it is
yiurbdaily practise not your avowed intentions that will send you tonjail
(imagine a world where the isnurance GUI sends out refusal letters while the policy manual says "we always treat our customerrs fairly)

so we can say "the code is the design" as the previous chapter argues

Now heres another question. If Roy schneider can read English
but cannot read Java code, is he immune from prosecution?
No. but perhaos equally he shoukdnnot be the CEO.

discuss VW scandal

A programmable comapnynisnone whose activites are 
primarily driven and decided by ore-writtensoftware
- from daybto day tactical, tomooerational and even strateguc

Now huge number if companies have day to day work
controlled by aoftware - frommobvious high speed traders 
and pretty much every hedge fund, to utilities like power and sewage companies

but more and more are tranistioning as 
it makes verification eaiset - for example there is a gorwing class of smart 
wrenches - it knows where it is on the assemly and will 
recird that the user tightened three times to X newtons.
somethig that is useful for operational and for liability concerns

software will tell us what to do, and record if we have done it 
(the field to factory model of industrial chnages)

but the point it more and more of a company is innansoftware feedbackmloop 
and in oore and more industries

more companies are becoming programmable 
innpart and in whole.

And accessing that data and controlling the decisions 
is management . "inused to but now am manager means you are 
roy schniwdrr / or company is not yet progrmamble - which means your competitrs will 



* I used to write English but now I am a manager I don't anymore
* Feudal management (the link to Totalitarian Bet)
* competion dont work - the too big to fail is like wealthy individuals -
  fincical gravity pulls the playing field in their favour.
  Large companies empoyee more fair share people, are notoriously inefficient,
  and focus on Iron Laws beureacrtacy, 
* The feudal management ceiling - too much infomration for any human to take on
  leads to "The Economist" decision making disease.
* Trusted advisors from below become subsumed in internal politics of
  organisation
* but the Feudal maangement ceiling can be raised, by software enabled
  transmission, models and OODA decision making.
* OODA loop and the decision making process, and how software eats that
* RObotics and robotic company, or more informed decision makers
* Whole org test rig
