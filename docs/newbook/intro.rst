Introduction
============

What is Software Literacy.
We are reshaping the world by making it explict, introspectable, open.
There are enormous implications.  Similarly in history we have chosen to become urban dwellers, agricutrlists,and now knowledge workers and organisers at scale

organising at scale
Teaching people how to become human, education - has had enormous benefits.

We have been reacting against being told  what to do - Trump to Brexit.
But we do need to identify the problem, identify a solution, do the solution. Nudges wont work.
Its too short a time scale to do it thorugh education

But openly modelling, providing literate solutions so people can read what and why they are guided.

This will help.
But not everyone

But toll is mental health issues that manifest in a urban buttoned down world.
But we have been given less freedom

Journalism is the training data for society - see weights and lawsuit from New York Times

Also see LLms are search across our societies knowledge (and cultural norms)

How has google search been replaced - by LLM

But what is was trained on matters - we need to see the “canon” and try to avoid the SEO poisoning of the well - that LLM training data and weights likely to be determined by government as it is likely to be the teaching assistant for future 

And we want to define that in same way we define the textbooks 

autism and rukes
- fristrationnof bureaucracy and lack of what rukes and where to look
it empowers thise innpower, but rikes take away power and priviledge 

software is operationalmrules - the advantages outweigh cost of openness
esp when closed approach goves priviledge


organisation - just gove cash to local communities
isnt that similar argument to just employ people and let them 


mgmt - model monotor mentor but mostly ensure continuation of org
when mission conflixts with org survival have pathologies

devmanual - tech lead as director of movie - setting stnadrds and color charts 


management - you do the work or you cause it to be done ... in your taste
workers do the work like canermen or set builders
the director ensures it is done to his or her taste. their colour oallette their speed and clarity
their ability to ensure others understand their taste ensures the outcome will be coherent

anything above this, anything that does not affect taste is finance

the banker might talk loudly about how he made the film possibke and the notes he gave - but thats crap
its just money

what we need is to understand where the lines are deawn 

executive producer in most organisations is timorous
