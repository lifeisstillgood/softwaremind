Totalitarian Bet
----------------

From guy in guardian. Essence is that China is betting that it can control its citizens using monitoring and social pressure.  Now worth talking about racist assumptions - china has a hugely strong culture of familial devotion and respect built in, so this is not like trying to monitor norweigans or Montana. 
       But it is also a totalitarian regieme using reeducaton camps against racial minority. SO its not nice.
       The problem is two fold. 
       1. This is how society does work.
       2. But its how society decides what is acceptble, what is to be pubished and what not.
       3. this is culture wars.  Is it ok for gay marriage.  My 7yo daughter knows most of the words to Katy Perrys; I kissed a girl (cherry chopsticks!) 

       It will work in reducing open dissent. But will it work in actaually changing minds.
