Democracy 
---------
Double down on democracy
- take detour to discuss Joseph schumpeter - he saw democracy not as a ideal in itself but as a method to discover what the people want - and the current democracy is not ideal
for that - so there can be a lot of experimentation 


One Inwoukd like to see is common now in project mgmt - rank ordering.  It is slowly entering program management - and it is hitting the ceiling of politics - if you rank order by the people, the resource allocation decisions are made by default and as such why have management / executives

But we could see new companies springing up - smaller companies and as such anoento select on their values systems - 

The flaw in the problem of ignorance. We don't need well informed electorates beyond a certain point - we can allow the market to find the efficient means to deliver a desired goal.  We just need to know enough to decide the stack ranking of each market - we need to understand the ramifications of prioritising climate co2 reduction against say the farming industry

See each market as a cell in larger host - and the democracy decision is what (minimal) regulations to use to put the desired relative weights of one against the other 


Schumpeter sees democracy as a completion between different "manifestos" of the political class - the one with the best persuasion wins. He explicitly links it to advertising 

But, looking at the cambridge analytics scandal and the problems - there is a correlation / causation problem.  Simply having slick advertising or 

You can poison the well, ala negative campaigning - but then who drinks from a poisoned well. 

You cannot tell who we are from our likes, and even if youndid get enough data to map us, i doubt you could craft a precise target ad more effective than "save the whales" or just "have some tax rebates".  Much like MKUltra the old standbys of bribery and threats will work just as well. (cf google va duck duck go)


And you cannot be all things to all people as your opponent will delight in pointing out your inconsistencies - we are in a competence market after all 



We are not so easily fooled.  Is the simple answer - human brains grew large it seems to deal with the problems of politics and game theory as tribal sizes grew.


We are not so easily fooled
---------------------------
New forms of democracy
Brexit and trump and five star - all voted for with eyes open by adults.
Might not like it but it's real.


Political entrepreneurship
--------------------------

Just as we think all the choices have gone, there is a political entrepreneur waiting to sell us more - beach left right ice cream and uk politics - new options, new sales

Is waiting for a manifesto correct? What about voting out / in executives in corporations? 

It's next obvious step.

What about using rank ordered policies ? 

Programmable company still needs men's rea or it will just be an AI seeking goals (paperclip goop)

So we need an ideal, we need vision and political eneprshop - but we also need that to more quickly guide the faster moving programmable more agile company - companies are getting ahead of our morality - that is not a problem with morality - it is a problem of the speed of feedback

Democracy is the right feedback mechanism - and we need to find better faster ways to guide the AI towards its goals - rank ordering, executive replacement etc

Coase tells us we could get down to a one person mega firm, but schumpeter tells us we would just have that guided by nothing - so we need to insert democracy 

(schumpeter democracy is genuine competition between polictakn entrepreneurs offering different packages and asking for power) 

Shape of future society
-----------------------

Firstly we can start with basics - 4biloikn smartphones we are all connected.  how does this shake out?
covid - we are not nations but one biosphere
- so are  atkins a useful idea? Common regulation - uber and amazon 
The EU and the african thing - future hope of society

But let's look at moop- it's where this stuff goes

but look at the obvious one - medicine. what lifestyle is most healthy.  This ooos an easy one - e felt look at Russia - life expectancy of 65 (pension age 66). Will the medical advice from epidemiology be "don't live under a mid-income dictatorship?"

the answer for western democracies - double down on democracy - look at EU look at thaler and libertarian xxx - look at sensible defaults - look at agents that actually work on our behalf 

MOOPs is the collection of data.

Agents acting in the best interests of user is the *advi e* based in the mass collection of data.

The next Larry Hagman in Dallas won't be actor pretending to be happy  - but will be a digital champagne socialist - sharing wealth of a country and not exploited by corporations and others - but aware and trading i off - the end of caveat emptor 

Other implications
- mesh networking will become a NSA funded thing - like TOR designed to undermine dictatorships.  it's probably the one most effective thing - but it will also allow fake news to spread.

so we need to find ways to inoculate society - and that's still a great great challenge - mostly relying on the common sense of most people. 
it's not that bad an idea? children a/ education 
Idea: alternative history gives interesting way to validate my mental models of democracy against yours - if we arrive at same society we have same operating models - and really that's what we care about in a democracy - shared oersting models

and guess what software is good at?

Search is crap now
------------------
https://sparktoro.com/blog/in-2020-two-thirds-of-google-searches-ended-without-a-click/

- It's so easy to spam with words now that it's more or less reached the point where google cannot tell difference between a valuable blog post by an expert and SEO manufactured rubbish


- So they keep you on site (sort of like a vast encyclopaedia)

- or you bounce to high trust curated sites (stack overflow) (NB - all props to Joel but once again labour is not rewarded equal to the value created - those are *unpaid* moderators making the site valuable.

- So there needs to be a cost in production of the content - youtube for example - want to see how to lay laminate floor, well you need to have a camera and a person and he'll a room with laminate flooring needed - that's a big cost. Lowes has made a video, so have dozens of contractors.  It's amazing how tool rental firms have not advertised on there ... actually that is a bit weird

Search quality is crap

Search is however the (only) way to reach people? Isn't it?

relevant Content on high production cost platforms.



- how will the changes in tech (smartphone device, 
walk through all
 - legal / regulation - business model for tech - ) change the society (cities transport education etc)
 
 
- sensor collection and moop
- privacy vs who is allowed to use it for what purpose 
- what is facebook - it is ideal demographic breakdown machine 
- where will data be stored and where will code run and ow will the two be logged - this is basically the important part.  data colours

The open source quandary
------------------------
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25896351

- essentially OSS circumvents the gatekeeper of purchase orders - so we end up using code with odd licenses and no one knows when where (ie npm)

- redhat has the right approach and I expect this to expand - there will be curated open source companies supplying not just licensed code with verified supply chains but also expertise


 
 at least sensible second order effects
 
 Try and build sensible future landscapes and climates, and discuss software doctrine (dev manual)
 
purpose and leaders hip are weaker effects

Double down on democracy
------------------------

Brexit (putting wish fulfilment before facts / which textbooks you read as a schoolchild)

also internal politics of a company are almost entirely non-market (patronage society)
patronage bad way to run society - see "get colonised by the british"

Most companies internally are still in 1980s digital - and looking to advance - imagine a world where we say "look at that market opportunity - i should take over the invoicing dept by being more efficient han them"
