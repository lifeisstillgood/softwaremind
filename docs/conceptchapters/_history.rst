80s as rise of open source and 90s rise of PC, and internet, 'a PC on every dsktop' to iPhone a supercomputer in every pocket.

Next step is agents working on our behalf - needing improved security, meaning of privacy and abiity to view review it ourselves and self programming - open and programmable.  And to move beyond the individual to programming the group, the company, the society.




Alan Turing and the road to Software 
-------------------------

I believe that software is best seen as a new form of literacy, and so it has two competing aims - to be able to run as billions of binary instructions on a CPU, and also to be comprehesible to human minds.  I am incapable of performing billions of binary calculations per second, but on a daily basis my collegues and I share software between each other and are able to reason about the outcomes of the software and the bugs we have inevitably added and diverted us from the true purpose of coffee drinking.

So Software has two compilers to target - (trained) human minds, and the hardware inside every Motherboard.

Hw we got there is the story of at least one genius and the horrors of the second world war.

Alan Mathison Turing was 27 years old when he walked through the gates of Bletchly Park, the UK Governments Code and Cipher School (GCCS), just a day after the declartion of War by the UK on Germany. 


The BioPic film (The Lying Game) starring Benedict Cumberbatch follows the common view of a lone genius struggling to realise his dream against a stupid and pompous establishment.  And while I love any film I can persuade my kids to watch that teaches even a passing resemblance to history (look its him from Avengers), Turing had already been working with the government and Polish Intelligence in their attempts to break Nazi Ciphers for over a year, his work on both sides of the Atlantic having been well recognised.

Turing built electronic machines (crib - a plaintext we can assume is in the cipher. As such we can eleimnate many positions (the not ciphering to oneself). Then the bombe is used to try all positions possible to get letter E to D and z to R If some of those positions collide we eliinate those, and so on and so on.)



Turig forsaw software as solution to thinking

I am still sticking with my "software as a form of literacy" concept.  But just as literacy was not possible without some form of mark-making technology (from clay and stick, to ink and pulp) literacy itself "transcends" the technology, but cannot exist without it - a virtual and real life split perhaps.

#Anyway the point is software is dependant on a compiler and a computer to actually fuction, yet on a daily basis my collegues and I review and read code that goes through no compiler other than each others brains.  But we need the experience of the code functioning in real life, to see the outputs running,
t hear as it were, the reeds clacking, so that we can model it in our heads and decide where to go next.

Different technologies drive different computing capabiities, which drives the software literacy tropes / genres we use to represent the new capabilities.

Yes we could all write assembler or even binary, and you know, people did. But we could all count by marking one line after another till we reached our age, but instead symbols encapsulate greater and greter higher level interpretations.

A story.
Databases waited for the technology to move from tapes to random access disks. Then we could get random access to any chunk of data enabling a new way of laying out data physically allowing for new ways to query and then SQL 
 

I think this is analsous to science fiction writing.
Shakespeare used fairies because aliens were not a well understood concept to his audience.  And rembmer tha software is both expressing ententions to a computer / compiler, it is also (equally? More so?) expressing intentions to the human reader (who needs to agree or understand and partner with the work)

John Backus and the road to Fortran
-------
- Organisation and subversion 
- The development of in redibly sophisiticated weaponry (radar, cavity magnetron, nuclear fission, jet turbines, proximity fuse (Tizzard mission)

all needed computing power to go firther model more




UNIX

Editor for mortals
Baked into and starting to eat the world - see rows of accountants and replacing them - films stills of tony hancock and then maggie smith film

Unix leads to common operating system 


Linux and the socialism of software 
----------------------
Open, sophisticated but rough, best sevelopemnt practises 

Open in social orgbaisation - the issues of toxic relationships and better solutions


Microsoft, WYSIWIG and dead ends
------------------------
Its not software - low code and no code. Cutting out marvel comic panels and rearrnaging them. It works to an extent and great practitioners can oroduce something *fast*. But it is more like a DJ remixing. There is nothing wrong per se, there is a need for a busines to just get onwoth it.  But from the stand point of a fully literate society, remixing Panels from Marvel comics is missong the point (and dont get me started on the legal issues of trying to add in panels from DC comics!)
