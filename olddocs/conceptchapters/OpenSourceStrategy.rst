If you have downstream ensure they are collaborators as much as users - having people contribute make

also have a commercial offering - maybe early access or something else

Cities internet and open

Cities were and experiment in neolithic.  Idea of cramming everyone into one space requires much adjustment on social scale and social networks and hierarchies

Internet is similar experiment and we are looking for new ways to make our society work

Enforcement is one possible (not preferable).  So the other is education and incentives

Perfect incentive would be hard but would happiness via moop be an idea? What about a society of sane defaults. (ie SAYE for all)



Drone warfare
----------//-/

thru 1860-2020 technology change drive warfare - not expert but seems cyber war and drone tech is doing it again.  See turkey in battle 

So security very important - likely to see a standard hardware chip being approved as open source, performant *enough* at some 20nm level and able to be trusted abs hardened and decentralised and on shores at reasonable cost.  oth space and aerospace -  heap flying drones rather than expensive fighter "platforms" likely to be the solution - why have an F35 super platform that can do everything when you can just have a different drone for the different tasks? 

(small drone vs air raft replacement) 




Foss and funding ?

Traditional Product liability and FOSS

Security and traditional product liability
------------------------
This is the only thing to improve security - mandatory breechbreporting and traditional product liability for vendors - with a sunset time period for existing code bases.

Massive drop in sales and code volume and many other things - but an increase in secure operations - and probably simplicity and evryually value (ie massive enterprise should be Boeing like levels of complexity - there should be one or two people who do understand it all)

Just very simple things, like reimplementing non-performance-sensitive C software from the 1990s and 2000s in simple memory-safe languages; it can't happen, the budget to make it happen would totally disrupt P&L at large companies; repeat with every well-known risk this kind of code is exposed to. I don't think we know how to solve this problem, which is why I tend to recoil from policy proposals to "solve" it.
