Literacy

Programmable has an extra literacy issue - as well as sounding like you know what a subject is about, code actually has to work - further increasingly likelihood the coder understands the subject - welcome to the antidote to fake news 

society needs to agree on base facts, and then agree on a model through which to process those facts

this is the fake news problem - there is some disagreement on what is a fact, but mostly it is what facts are important - which is how are our models built - what facts do they use to trigger our concerns 

Explicit models may help here - certainly an option for people to have examinations models as manifestos

programmable company / society / people

View on internet and programming 

Tech has confused / conflated programming and internet companies - internet companies like facebook and google have populated a new space called the internet - like radio and tv companies populated a new industry 

But they are not exclusive to programming - that has more change and growth to come - at a deeper lelvel 

Society: avoiding the middle income trap 

State was just for warfare then became possible to organise at scale (writing) and states had mass - now they had dependnscy on population and needed to keep it healthy etc

The middle income trap is hard to quantity - but shows a retreat of state control (directed central) ans towards aliases dairel - but is that true - is money spent in military industrial actually producing ROI ? 

States before 1600 were retinues of retinues so had serious opposition to mad kings.  slowly the beureauct centralised power - and literacy enabled such command and control

industrial revolution allowed for such growth and electronic communication allowed for totalitarianism - total control.

Internet firms as 
democratic institutions 

- we are moving away from our institutions cos our life is going on line

but we need 


Data Driven
-----------
Sounds good - but *getting* the data is the challengeZ

Look at the splintered company (lots languages and systems barely workijg together) (see army analogy - eventually you want to stop using special forces)

Most reporting systems are human mediated - not automated - in an enterprise - and that becomes Chinese reporting- making look good to your bosses - ultimately why a programmable company is desirable - it is transparent and so truth

only bad leaders really say "lie to me"

Publish data into a public sphere and allow people to collect it losslessly

trust that they will respect the colours assigned 


Once data is free code will be free too

A communal data access layer - PII data should be available

Web 2.0 is not the last internet epoch (see stratechery) - it was just a UI 

it's about access to data and formats - security yes but also just access - data should stay where it is and you ask to access it and cache it as needed 

append only caches are easy to keep 

So who owns data 

KYC becomes a mantra


Vulnerable do not need anonymity- they need not to be vulnerable / attacked

Managing complexity of software os an organisation problem and is defining challenge - being able to change your org to accept softwares next challenges will define if you make it.  And pretty much no company that is not lead by a software literate leader will manage - and even those that are will suffer legacy problems 

- best way for a business to change is to build the new business and reverse itself in.  But then the goodwill is predicated on the prooor systems and structures 

Biggest issues

- how to own data across a company and control changes schemas 
- how to manage data types 
- data provenance 
- data colours 
- sharing common knowledge (code reviews,)

essentially only solutions are strong data typing, and consequentially approved data types.  you cannot define your own classes anymore.  Inwoukd say the end of object orientated and rise of functional data types (in other words you cannot have functions that work on data in the data type anymore) 



these are not "security"
issues - they are software issues 


freedom and democracy
---------------------
MOOP implies two approaches to the "centaur" for our daily lives.  A patients best interests approach - one of individual liberty enhanced with the lessons and learnings from epidemiology- and a totalitarian approach - a suppressive technology that tells everyone what to think abs not think.  How successful is that ? 

Will there always be a suppressive effect? Yes, Kim Kardashian is aaare she is being filmed.  But it's hard to say if she is hiding much ? And we will find options. holidays and breaks - bathroom breaks etc 

We must build our democracies with software not despite it, and build them as shining beacons - because they will hold us 

and we cannot avoid it.
