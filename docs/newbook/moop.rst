MOOP
====

- the professionalisation of taxation and governance 
at start of american revolution meant friction and problems

moop is basically surveillance if activity - including fiat based cryptocurrency 
but it can be a good thing but also likely to be shaoed as government overreach

but only fovernment can prevent market private abuse

somunless we acxept government moop contols (nanny state)
we will see the pricate abise (advertising and worse)

so democratic bet leans on government nanny state control for important levels 


Been banging on about this for a decade. Massive Open Online Psychology. How we behave is visible to all - recordable, analyseable. Is the manager of the team following the 8 leadership principles of google? We expect the maangement to moniotr that. What if the police style body cam strapped to his tiepin just helps that? What happens when the collated experience of 100 million people are condensed into daily advice for a person living their life.
        Not merely sensible index fund investing, but best ways to act with your other half, the advice for working with kids or your manager.  What if instead of taking a pill the best life advice comes from HIPPA level app on your phone.  What if people using this for a decade are measureably fitter, healthier, happier, wealthier than the control group?

Transition layer - management does not have information systems capable of two way piercing of transmission layer - so there is a layer of people looking for and using low code solutions (incl excel) to pass data and analysis 

see that tweet ? from guy talking about using stuff in monzo 


Fiture AI
future AI is like future robot - it wont look like a butler and an AI agent persona wont have to be super intelligent

So I see MOOP as aignificant part of this - it does not take AGI to 

ot take topless computing (see European banking regulations) and it takes robust privacy laws (HIPAA equivalent)
then its a case of conversations like

Have you finiahed hanging up the last load of washing?


moop - digital archaeology 
history of a wedding ring 

surveillance - good bad or indifferbet?
----------------------------------------
Everything we do is will be monitored with sensors - that can be good
