Equal Say, Equal Share
----------------------

The point is FDR was a traitor to his class.  And that he understood something that is rarely accepted in political circles.  An equal say means an equal share.  And if the answer is 'the plebs only get a say once every four years and the elite get a say every day, look at what explicit implicit and openness directionality means.  There is only so long people can put up with Dark Pools - isnt there? 


Productivity - the key?
-----------------------

Many economists today bemoan lack of productivity growth 
as a major reason for economic failings.  As an example 
in UK wages have not risen since 2008 crash.  If we had enjoyed growthbrates similar to 1990-2005
or much of post war period UK worker average wage would be 10,000 GBP better off.

Thats a huge number 

Now 

we see computers everywhere but in the productivity numbers

Conjecture: The virtual-irl link, software / reality gap
can be bridged by software literacy in many cases (having people able to read and write, plus aoftware that is deaigned for onward use (topless) plus 
greater reach of software (sensors, actuators) will provide productivity chnages.

Most enterprises are largely over staffed - so why arent they culled??

Because most enterprises are not staffed by fools ...
well

conjecture on the theory of the firm - 

- lack of insight into internal
process - ie deep state and lack automation

- the faikure of large plans - it is ventire captial 
and people kind of knownot - but ahoukd embrace that majority of venture captial 
is spent internally not externally.  traditional VC only gets the truly disruotive companies - thatvwill destroy intentql homeostatis of 
companies - and most companies dont face existential threats which is why silicon valley is mostly unique - its more schumpter than the test rather than the wearher

- shared treasiry leada to funding multiple other bets

- programme mgmt isnmostly about intenal VC mgmt - and worse using politics ans not metrics like teaction
