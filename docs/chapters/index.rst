The Software Mind

Introduction
============

We see new IT as being co-ordination not communication. emails were communicating. we have that. productivity will come from mass co-ordination, what that will look like may be saas apps on phones helping workflow but also sourcing cheapest products or ?? 

why secure enclave workflow apps somimportant 

Ultimately we need our software to help us, not serve us up to corporations for their benefit. 
Software needs to be written altruistically - to be not just the best code, but tonaim for the best outcomes - to help us

The 1815 wave to now - reasons for optimism
and reasons for assuming what we foresee will be - everywhere- and so why the programmable company and moops are likely destiny.

The Software Literate Company
=============================


<Guidance notes to vanish from index as fleshed out>o
* Software literacy, the challenges faced
* programmable company
* coase based sizes, remote workers, productivity, regulatory
  alignment and remote workers
* impact of open ness and democracy on decision making and trust of
  products ->
* test cases like Knight Capital and even microsoft (vista). single correct codebase

I have worked, and still do work in some of the world's leading
corporations, or most vibrant startups. And they have almost unifromly
been staffed by talented, driven and intelligent

But the talent, drive and intelligence has always had problems
translating into the actions of the organisation, even to the extent
of closing doors.

Yet when we write code we expect the decisions made in that code to
translate into definiteve action by the computer.  Why is there such a
disconnect?

The opportunity and the problem are the same thing - a programmable
company will do what it is told, not have internal debates.  And that
is going to lead to amazing productivity benefits. and terrifying
consequences.

Factories are to Industrial Engineers what Server farms are to Software engineers - they have uptime requirements and monitoring needs and so on.  And we shall see more of the company being treated as a factory floor and less and less as "the office above the factory"



(start with productivity debate, move to assumption about
electrification and software. We are expecting to replace the 23M USA
"office and process support workers" with a lot of perl scripts.  But
we need to do 3 things first

* actually define what we want done (80% and 98%) - architecture and
  software
* define a process to agree what we want done (policies - they will be
  readable)
* deifne process to report those to the rest of the world - regulators
  or branding, being a black box will be insufficnet to be trusted.
  And Our APIs become 'testable' - you will not hide their actions.

<Image of fish with clear head.>  

That is the coming transformation of the corporation. Greed will lead
them there, but they must take on the mantle of governance, else we
will not trust them.

Also communication to co-ordination to collaboration.  Software and internet
have easily enabled the first.  And the productivity benefits surely must exist.
But co-ordination - thats going to be huge. and seen in strange new areas.

Governance problems in blockchain and oss projects
- a review - The debian init, blockchain size, other voting systems. the benevolent dictator model has been most successful, along with voting for representatives (debian)
direct democracy has not succeeded it seems based on gamification 

blockchain is a capital allocation and organisation approach

it is reductionad absurdem but it is the ultimate programmable company - a company ledger can co ordinate and incentivelse people

the death of rent seeking
why is facebook messages sent from uk village to SF and back next door
rent seeking - the idea is twitter the protocol not twitter the company

we are already in the future - we just are looking in the rear view mirror 

http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/item/5c0ce0ab-c88f-45be-b44d-59841e5f9e64 Charlie Beooker seems to be very good at spotting the future that is already here.

* privacy problem - PII data, European GDPR
* Algorithms and us

Common solution is more openness,
Lets all laugh at commercially confidential as a phrase

Death of Rent seeking and Crypto Currencies
The more Ra-Ra end of the Cryptocurrency, bouyed it must be said by buying
bitcoin at 5 cents and flogging around 14 grand, think that the new infrastructure,
digitally native it being laid down.  The basic idea is why should companies like twiter or
facebook cpature so much of the value of what is social interaction.

This is a Libertarian take on much of what I argue elsewhere in the book, and
frankly its better than nothing.  There are significnat problems with bitcoin,
but the openness of the blockchain ledger has many exciting possibilities.

Also taking back control - Moops and Fathers

IoT and open protocols- we are losing this already - and we need it back.  it's not clear how to get ahead of this without regulation or front running RFCs
Pax Technica - Paxromana/britannia's was the local maxima - one culture won sooo decisively everyone just went with it.  the next pax will be one of technically influenced pax. the more openness the better. but will we get theee, or is technology just going to lead to its own level ?

How we behave is as important as how we vote - how we vote is just a proxy for what we want - as is our daily, monitored, behaviour. 

as such we at least need our behaviours data to be available back to us. perhaps to help us improve, at least to help us verify our reputation and maybe as a means to control what is seen ornknown by others.  but doing so will involve great changes to current security and commercial and political models - and it is the last of these that is least solidified 

there are two aspects, 

real / virtual nodes
  where and when 
  
data cole ted and inferred
  what data
  
algorithms and processes
  Can i know if you used my data and how was it used how and who
  
  
these are all old and simple ideas - expressed in earliest data protection legislation.  but we still have not solved it (brexit and yes minister)

we need to look to support openness in all areas - ownership (and control) of infrastructure, content and policies - net neutrality is not something to be taken lightly - it has already been lost in the home of the free.

Democracy in the small
- it's collective action but how to aggregate it so nothing is missed?
- modelling so we can see what is priority, what is wrong, what is hidden.
- childline as a feed into research
- one working model of the world? 


Good things
 service design manual - it's really simple but very powerful
 Normalisation against extremist views (good and bad). Downvoting.
 collective action can work but it's more like winning the online lottery than a fix for consistent government action
 Iot and internet has been weaponised - but as long as everyone has the weapons it neutrally? unless is manipulation as a weapon when we need to know if been fired
 
 which internet we choose is which chimpanzee we want to be - abundance or starvation
