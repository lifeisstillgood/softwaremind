Super Co-operative Species
--------------------------

The idea humanity is so successful because we are super- co-opearive,
                                         beyond simply working with family or local tribe, we have discovered 
                                         specialisation, trade and the enormous benefits of being oragnised beyond
                                         our immediate tribal groupings.  ANt colonies are amazing, but where is the inter-colony trade?
