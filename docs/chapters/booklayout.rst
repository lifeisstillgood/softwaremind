    "Software is eating the world".

    "And it's starting to get indigestion."
    Author. 


The central tenet of the Software Mind is that Software is a new form
of *literacy*.

Just imagine what literacy did to every walk of human life as it spread. The world
of Medieval Monks in Scriptoreums had embedded in it newspapers, bus
timetables, ballot papers and user manuals, but you try predicting
that from a bunch of itchy, bald-headed guys holding feathers.

It is this books' assertion that *Software Literacy* in the 21st
Century is as deep and as profound as reading and writing was in the
15th, and will have impacts as long-lasting on the human race
(assuming we all make it that far.).  And some people get it - and
some people don't.  So this book is an attempt to try and persuade
some of the don't side that this really is important.

Main Themes of the Book
------------------------

We are going to cover a lot of ground - after all if Software really
is eating the world, we need to cover the whole dinner plate.

But luckily there are Themes that are emerging across the Globe that
not only highlught the shape of the problems, but show the shape of
the solutions being attempted as well.

Ultimately this is a optimistic book, Software and Software literacy
can, or even will, deliver enormous benefits to humankind.  Its just that
the transition period might be hard and long, or easy and short.  I
am optimistic we can get the best deal for humans we can.


Engineering problems

  Writing large-scale software that works is, frankly, hard.  It is a
  very complex engineering problem, and there are emerging consensus'
  on the right ways (or perhaps the wrong ways).  We look at some case
  studies like Target and Knight Capital.

  * studies on Target etc
  * Teams and moops
  
Company Problems

  
  In large code bases there are 2 kinds of governance
  problem - making sure that the code base adheres to its quality
  standards, for example regression testing, style checking and other
  'audit' processes.  And another, more common idea of governance, of
  how do we make the decisions on what software to write, and what
  policies to place in the software.

  The software development profession has gotten much much better at
  the first type - Continuous Integration is a mantra for all not just the
  best organisations now.  This helps overcome problems like Knight Capital.

  However the deeper governance problem, of what software to write, and
  what policies that software will enforce is far less developed - we live in
  young democracies, but we work in top-down dictatorships.  

  A model solution for this is not just "Democracy" as we vote in
  every few years, but the open discussion model of OSS development
  (ie Linux). (The open discussion used to be proxied via 'media' but that was corrupted,
  and is now disrupted. A new solution is needed.)

    Kathy ONeil, AI, and so on.

  Conways Law and Regulatory convergence
    Software is shaped like the org that build it, or it shapes the organisation.
    Why I think we democracies should write lots of government software.

  
Government Problems

  One of the biggest themes is that as more and more of our lives move
  "online" or become "digital", then we take more and more of our
  expectations for how "society should be" online.  For exmaple,
  no-one wants paedophiles to be trawling the YouTube-Kids comments
  sections, but YouTube found it was not policing the process well
  enough.

  Companies that look insanely profitable now, are going to find they
  need to perform the policing and governmental roles that we expect
  (or perhaps have those roles ceded to outside regulatory agencies.).
  The vast open prasiries that Apple, Google and Facebook enjoy now,
  are not going to remain open for ever.

  Privacy and pollution Problems
    Data in companies.
    Data should be immovable. Neutron Stars.
    Meta Data is what we care about.
    Pollution problem
    EU and GDPR
 
  Security Problems
    Snowden
    Intel ME, Spectre etc
  


Summary
-------

- we shall live online, at least partially. So we shall need to take governments with us.
- good engineering makes us all better and safer, and good engeineering needs support legal, poltical and social, else the forces of greed will win out.
- democracy is still young - and we shall see it transform companies and societies. FOr the better.
