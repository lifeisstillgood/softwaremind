Why Mailchimp means Brexit is doomed
=====================================

Mailchimp is happily accepting 
EU is being a rule setter here - doing the simple thing of being the first, the highest standard. It is inevitable this will be the gold standard - and everyone else will take these rules or stop processing data of EU citizens (yeah ... hmm)

And yet Britain's red line is one of not being a rule taker.

We give up that as we leave - just as the EU starts defining privacy 

I happen to disagree but you cannot deny the thing exists.
