The Evolving Understanding of Management and organisations
===========================================================

"Management" is a fairly modern term - probably Peter Drucker is most
responsible for popularising it in the 50s and 60s.  His work laid a path that
most academic work has followed. To very harshly paraphrase his work, In his
work, Mgmt should be an elite, trained for highest performance, to innovate, to
analyse, to *decide* and *change*.  These are supermen, bestriding the world.

.. epigraph::

   The fact is, that in modern society there is no other leadership group
   but managers. If the managers of our major institutions, and especially of
   business, do not take responsibility for the common good, no one else
   can or will.

   -- Drucker, 1973 Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices

Wow. These guys mean business.

Management had many functions in his books which boil down to
increasing productivity, motivating employees, organising and managing
societal impacts and biggest - setting objectives - objectives in productivity,
market stadning, financial resources, profuitability, employee and managerial
performane and training.

https://www.torontosom.ca/blog/a-profile-of-peter-f-drucker-father-of-modern-management

Now we should be fair to Drucker, he saw this idea of management more as
a responsibility,  liberal arts, non-profit, fairness to workers.
But another phrase for this is 'noblese oblige'.  Management is still an elite
in his books.  And Management was for setting and directing via objectives.

However things changed.  Management in 1960s were still thought of as employees,
working for a shareholder class.  And while they got *perks*, they rarely got
*capital*.  And slowly that changed until the 1980s exploded and the majority of
upper management income came not from salaries but from equity (options).
And slowly they stopped being "management".

In 2002, shortly after IPO, Google's founding engineers thought they would be clvere and
get rid of managers entirely. They were staffed by clever engineers after all.
It did not work well.  We can discuss why but the upshot was Project Oxygen - a study
from around 2009 monitoring which teams did well and which managers managed them.

They identified 8 rules that the best maangers followed.

Google then followed that up with Project Aristotle, which identifed what qualities
a high performing team in Google had.



And in 2012 Google's eight rules came out, as summarised by NYT as ::

  But Mr. Bock’s group found that technical expertise the ability, say, to
  write computer code in your sleep ranked dead last among Google’s big eight.
  What employees valued most were even-keeled bosses who made time for
  one-on-one meetings, who helped people puzzle through problems by asking
  questions, not dictating answers, and who took an interest in employees’
  lives and careers.

Oh so, you know. A Sports Coach or a Life Coach. [#1]

As for the best teams, well Project Aristotle found they needed... Psychological
Safety. ::

  Instead, it's about being able to speak your mind without fear of judgment or
  retaliation. It's about feeling safe to take risks and make mistakes, knowing
  that your colleagues have your back and support your growth.

Wait what happened there? Where is all the "bend the organisation to your will"
stuff. Where is the "corporate strategy". What happened to bestriding the world
and exploiting your employees? What about decide and change? What about setting
objectives that everyone else just follows. What about telling people what to
damn well do and have them do it!

Where in the new softly softly rules for managers is the red meat of resource
allocation?

In my uneducated opinion, two things happened. Firstly the management split -
middle management stayed employees, and upper management became capitalists,
financiers.  Not only did CEOs grab enough options to spell FU, but
the worlds largest companies grew in size and reach. Globalisation became not just
how things were traded but how companies operated.

Adn Software happened. The actual work in Google is done by CPUs and GPUs. The
people who marshall and supervise and direct and organise the workers are the
people committing the code.

What is left out of GOogles 8 rules is how is what the team is working on decided
who decides what they get paid and what they produce?

Resource Allocation matters.  Lets look at Haier

(link: accountancy - the non softwaremethods of control, superseeded by direct measurement)

To me Middle management is now the job of the coder, the CPUs job is working.
Operations is the planning of data centre growth.  Straegic decisions about 1 GW
data centres matter.

But the finl decision, the sign off on the big spends, that is still
"management" as meant by Drucker.  And it is sorely in need of democracy.  But
it is being disaggegated.

Management is being disaggregated. But will Capital (in the Pikeety sense?)
Democracy is the biggest threat to capitalism.  And as the coders are the new managers, they will / are demandng a say at the top table

Its not enough that maangers are nice.  Its that the real decisions are made without the workers
And that is what feudalism to democracy has always been about.

So if you have a group of people working for you the way to get the best out of them is to be a sport coach,
and make the teams psychologically safe.  SOunds absolutely bang on to me. WOul dlike to try some of that persoanlly.
But the point is it does not touch on resource allocation, etc.

There is a split, a break. Management has split into financning and doing.

But if the coder is really new manager - allocating,
then the  middle manager is squeezed out and financing left.

This might tend towards

But coding seems to demand much much more people.

OSS companies - companies using same common codebase with minor changes to
core competance.


Disaggregation of management
----------------------------

The hierachy is broken. The people doing the actual design are not in the
hierarchy so how is the strategy conducted / directed? This is about *mission*,
and about the *whole org test rig* and eventually democracy - the middle class
will demand a seat at the table.

Go Higher Haier
---------------
OK, so there are not a lot of examples of companies doing things different.
One such is a Chinese "white goods" manufacturer *Haier*.
Back in 2009 the boss decided to do away with maangement (bit like google) but he did it slightly better


But - examples?
https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/a-business-of-its-times-haiers-self-evolving-organization

The *jobs* of management still need to be done. But do they need to be done by
a *class* of elite in an rigid hierarchy?

Reduced risk - literal bank in a box, can be produced (devmanual), so dont have to reincvent wheel

So its pretty silly to announce the internet, software, AI is going to change the
whole world, break barriers, disrupt everything, ... apart from hierarchical management
and corporate financing.

- Administration should be instantaneous
- Decisions get recorded (and possibly encoded, by tests)

The code is the design
======================

See essays


The Architects paradox
=======================

Architecg holds hand that sogns the cheque

todays architext relies on the people hited to make good craft decisions

tomorrows atchitect will use robots that wont make decisions or alter plans but will
treat the code as the design

if there is not weiggle room betwen code and design then 
you need robots not people 

AI is partly robot partly person ?

but just as architect will
need to specify mucj more upfront but will gains repeatability

the founder will need to specify more the capitalist will need apecify more
but will have more repeatbility 

will this chnage myire of organisations - smaller cellurlar atructire
highr trust neded - chnages to politics

chnage to roald coase - the problem is triat environment outside the org - that is the perview of government 



If you cannot control the work to each level, you need to leave thigns to chancve
/ others - and then

But with software and robots you can control it all, preplan it all.
Factory and Field



Coders are the new managers, CPUs are the new workers
================================================================



  - THoery of firm / how organisations will change


  "When Adam Delved and Eve span, who then was a Gentleman?"

    -- John Ball, (Peasants' Revolt) 1381

Tranisation from managers to coders reduces ability for non technical management
to know what is possible and how to implement next step on phase soace
management is becoming less abke to *dirext* and more able to *prevent* - old
saw of government having engine of lawnmower and brakes of rolls royce
leadership - saying its ok (sniper and injured enemy) impact of remote workinng

coders are the new managers
---------------------------

THe new workers are the CPUs. The supervisors and instructions come from the coders - and code is the design.  Look at difference between maangers in Drucker - bestriding the world making decisions, and managers in Googles eight rules - coaches helping keep the employees happy.  And what if employees are not happy - look at OpenAI where an emploee revolt removed the board.  We shall come back to employee ower later. WHy did rome collapse? Collapse of trust and trade.
management is dead -
coders are new managers
management is simple (peter principle)
management can be automated - to raise floor level
modelling
mentoring
monitoring
politicking  (financier and project choosing)
project / activity choice - resource allocation is mostly what *change* to apply - which is mostly a datwining process of project survival - so financing is process of finding successful projects not initiating successful projects
or finding obvious failings and initiating blessed solutions
management training matters but
is that training in coaching (google 8 rules) or training in project initiation and selection or training in political alignment
i hvave sympathy woth the control freaks because there is no standrdisatikn - no process (military word??)
there is need for soijg things this way my
way - commot formats and so on
management is basically xonsrant on job training of others
- linting humans
we live lives of imperfection and pretend every is fine and the dodson are between the two is our stress level - but admitting the truth is a way to find calm and time to fix the imperfections
the great innovations of 1776 enlightenment
democracy
openness / search for truth / scientific method
industrial revolution - automation finance and more
double down on what works
politician - consensus forming / finding
foncnciar - consensus funding
colonel
serfent
pricate


What do we mean by management?
------------------------------

This one we can bang on about for ages.  Everyone from Drucker to the latest
paperback in the airport lounge has some definition.  But I am going to stick to
my Sun-Tzu.  There are 5 "components" of warfare -Landscape, Weather, Mission,
Doctrine and Leadership.  Leadership is the "management" part we are discussing
here, and Leadership can influence the Mission, and change the Doctrine.  But it
cannot change the landscape or the weather.

So I am conjecturing that management of an organisation is the group of people
responsible for, no, *able to change or influence* the culture, incentives, rules
and policies of an organisaitoon.

This usually means people high up in a organisation hierachy, but we all too
often know of upper managemetn unable to change anything.  But *someone* in that
company can.

In the UK we have what is sometimes termed "The British Disease" - where some defitnin of poor managemnt
causes the low productivity seen in UK companies compared to their peers.

Instantaneous Administration
----------------------------
Admin should be instant. SoppY




Disaggreation of management
----------------------------

So what does management do?

Model
Monitor
Mentor
Politic


Drucker
Shared understanding of the groups common goals (mission)
(also shows where conglomerates exists as shared common goals are too vague)


Politics of the Organisation
----------------------------

THe most important part - politics of the organisation

Talk about Paula Vennels, Post Office.
That elites control ing a fiefdom is not usually the best way of getting performance
Can we expect Elon Musk like performance from every manager? Of course we f*****g cannot.
He is a once in a generation outlier for a f****g reason. And I dont know the names of the 100 people
what have worked directly for him over 20 years and shaped the success as much.

But we have found a new means of dealing with politics - we call it democracy.
It comes in funny shapes and sizes, and its very new but we have great hoppes for it.

But self organising sucks (structureless stuff like chiat day)
How to reward people? 
but anyway ... software 
Why need good managers ? to shield younfrom the politics and in foghting?
then the missing part is
democracy. you cannot get rid of politics - but you can 
remove the buts where individiulas are toompowerful 
Reward systems 
Video games teach us that regular frequent rewards are waay better than 
on off rewards. so why have annual appraisals - because having a manager there daily enabked daily approasals and reqard ( at least bu the good managers) 
So remotw work not somgood
having demos very good

The Architect's Paradox
=======================

An architect today can <design> a building, but leave many of the detaisl to be
worked out at construction time (they of course need to ensure load bearing
floors etc etc. But often this not work out - see NEw York famous.) But imagine
we create a robot that injects concrete exactly where its told. At this point te
architect can churn out hundreds of buildings at a time, but they need to
specify *everytrhing*.  This is the problem, opportunity and promise of software
as it eats the world - vast savings, vast control, but now everything must be
much more explicit.

The code is the design
=========================
Articles and discussion - when build is deterministic, the code is the design.
SO from now
on we see a world of programmable companies which are franchises, with a franchise of one.
 Real working policy documents. The goal of SOPpy is to partly allow one to write code
that runs a company, but also to write policy documents that read as policy but execute as
code. Cucumber

There are many silly things in the film Gettysburg (1993), but one moment I just
love is Chamberlain’s exasperation on realizing on top of an already difficult
morning that his regiment has been assigned to the front of the front brigade in
the corps and so has to assign flankers; that rotation would have been regular
in most armies. And what would have happened to create this scene, is that the
commander of the V Corps (Major General George Sykes) opted to march with his
first division in the front, which then its commander (Brigadier General James
Barnes) opted to put the 3rd Brigade in front and its commander (Col. Strong
Vincent) opted to put the 20th Maine in front and of course its commander (our
Professor of Rhetoric, Joshua L. Chamberlain) would in turn have to pick where
each of his companies would go. The main concerns for smaller units is that the
front part of the unit regulates pace and the rear part of the unit will need to
deal with stragglers (including heat and fatigue casualties) as well as keep up
pace to avoid the unit ‘tailing out’ too badly as it marches.

that is real management / leadership - making cog level decisions
that can if got wrong badly adfect everything but if right just keep going

humming along is what (well designed) software can do
when it goes wrong we need to tke action (preplanned automatic action??)
runbooks etc

the less manual the more speed etc etc

yes there is a risk (see automatic driving - hi this is an issue software cannot
handle you have 2 seconds to avoid a crash)



  - how do companies decide?
    robotics useful 
    simple terms - OODA loop 
    observe is perception - collection of data
    orient is collating data into a model that 
    is an effective representation of reality 
    decide is choices based on model, model predictions plus politics
    Act is chnage the code and release 
    how does this help us - it goves model for how
    programmable company can work - we are seeing software eat
    the world at the observe stage - but rarely do we see a whole org
    model that is ontegrated into thise 
    AI is sorta hoped / worried it will do this second stage (and DAnd A)
    but explicitly calling itnout its clear one can easily domit
    but it challenges the existence of feudal
mgmt elite that "understands" the company
    cf VAR - "get me one single number to judge company bu"
    ok but once we do, anyone can judge it - that model is built
    it is available
    counterpojt - there are too mmay variables we have to do this by feel
    yeah bollocks
  - THoery of firm / how organisations will change
  - Coders are the new managers, CPUs are the new workers (as almost every job has co-pilot or enabled by software / robot / machine)

Non Jobs
=========







Non Jobs 80% of 80% -> 96% from 36%. How project manaement will be removed from companies
as
      co-ordination is driven through test rigs and APIs and 'measure of progress is
workig software' A screed against project maangement-ism.  Also why are companies not
using metrics and data to drive outcomes - AB testing your way  to success? Or to be out
of a job?

The SDLC - Literate Best Practise / The DevManual

confidentiality.
simplest possible complete software ecosystem - devmanual
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"

Chapter: Literary Best practise
===============================
Software demands different best practises
We are finding them - and what it will look like makes WaPo different to a
medieval scriptoreum.
Prod-Parallel and back testing,
Tool use
COmmon solutions (octavio, editing)
THis is The DevManual
To "manage" you need to have an OODA loop.
To "release with confidence" you need to have a prod-parallel env / test rig.
To "plan" you need to have failing tests in the prod-parallel env, that are like
bug bounties for employees.  DO not fall for capitalism here, use socialism
inside the org.

Chapter OODA loop and production ready, tech debt.
==================================================

Observe, Orientate, Decide, Act.
This is operating *on* an existing system. We are managing the system.
If we cannot get metrics from the system, we cannot observe
If we do not have a (software) model of the system we cannot orientate,
(use of Statitical process control)
Deciding is politics - persuasion, allocation of resources, collection of
resources.
Act is development
The main issue is we have *assumed* the model is in the managers head, or
in their holy spreadsheet.  Possibly because the numbers in the sheet are
'dangerous' to pass around.
But with software metrics, thats a choice not a requirement. A model can be
"soft real time" updated, and the VAR number calculated each day.
Deciding is affected to, as differnet costly options can be appplied to model
and prod-parallel for analysis.
And Act is the art of filling in the red failing tests in the prod-parallel.

“It was a bad call ripley a bad call”
The thing is there are skeletons everywhere
Director hazing is also there not just to weed out the bad ones but find the ones who fit, who won’t make waves who won’t “overturn the boat” - even if some boats need overturning

It’s always a balancing act but at some point the skeletons just become self reinforcing - and you either never make any compromising mistakes (see why lawyers have professional ethics) or you find ways to air the dirty laundry often

.. [#1] If you are interested this is the full 8 rules

    Be a good coach.
    Empower your team and do not micromanage.
    Express interest in team members’ success and personal well-being.
    Be productive and results-orientated.
    Be a good communicator and listed to your team.
    Help your employees with career development.
    Have a clear vision and a strategy for the team.
    Have key technical skills so that you can help advise the team.
