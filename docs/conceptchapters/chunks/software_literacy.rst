Software literacy
=================

Just how much of current business does *not* get written down - that's how much should not be in software 



it's not like engineering or science - it's not a science
(algorithms are but that's not most computer programmaubg(

it's not engineering like building an aqueduct abs people benefit from it by getting clean water or getting tweets

it's liteeacy in that most people will read and write abs will benefit directly in their gooddaily lives, abs that there will be second order benefits to all society that's
we can barely believe right now

but we have the historical precedent of literacy to guide us

And to get those before we need to build new structures and institutions and practise a - like libraries (see google is dying) 

and in this software literate world - everything is programmable (topless computing) - people companies society 

libraries etc etc 


(usual intro) then 


Second phase of the car industry
----------------------

Ben evans talks about first fifty years of cars - and second was dominated by GM etc

but the car is not to be seen as the whole industry - the car is the *platform* or *utility* (diff is in tax and regulation levels) - so you could not build walmart or the supermarket in 1920 because not enough people had a car so you had to take the groaceries to within walking distance - but by 1980 car penetration was deep enough as was use of databases and inventory mgmt and barcodes and so on.

So software literacy is a choice - and there will be levels of literacy penetration.  what is penetration (commit rates) for google? 

So because what walmart does is enabled by abs necessary for *car ownership* it does not make walmart a car compmay.

and so because every bank and newspaper and etc is enabled by internet ("tech") it does not make them a tech company.

But it does make them need to be software literate - to both have programmers on board but also to put software deep into every part so that it can be monitored and policy triggers 

NB - barcelona city super blocks - now groceries within walking distance is a policy choice not a market driven solution - this is the failure of "market ideology" - when market can supply different outcomes based on guardrails 

How to manage literacy
----------------------
Journmalism 
- lead by example vs iron fiat
journalist have "iron fist" throw it all out start again - how to "manage" literacy 

Another introduction
--------------------

This book is based around a single axiom : That computer software is a new form of literacy.  I want you, dear reader, to accept this as it is the basis for all going forward.  It is a little hard to take such things on faith, but a few nudges might help.

Firstly one that threw me completely- did you know that the walls of Jericho were thirty feet high almost 2000 years before writing was invented?  You see writing is a form of technology - it needed to be invented, supported.  Humans were building structures, humans were *engineering* walls, and building machines to help undermine or assault those walls) for 20 centuries before 
they thought to write about it.

Secondly, 

we already have AI - the crowd, the group, the organisation, the state - it's just slow and hard to introspect



Software development 
--------------------

I think writing is an excellent metaphor for software development 

- well defined outocomes 
"a novel"?
"a love story"
"chapter 13 needs to be about the break up"


this is not how we write stories - it might work for encyclopaedia but a book is a book not a collaborative work 

we don't have perfect metaphors - but we didn't for writing in 2000bc or even 0bc

Productivity debate
--------------------

finally software literacy solves for me one of the great economist conundrums - computers appear everywhere but in the productivity statistics - because we have succeeded in putting pen and paper on every desk, but barely anyone can read or write, and the libraries, bookshelves, letter service etc are woeful

Implications for organisations 
------------------------------

"""I used to read and write, but I don't do reading and writing anymore now I am a manager."""

Think Ben x in all
presidents men - how do we arrange a company so the reading and writing is still vital part of the job at the top? 

How ? that is what we will
loo at in the next part 

best options for avoiding organisational think (like group think but trapped in org power structures ie please your boss) is *tenure* - why founders are effective  - same as FU money
