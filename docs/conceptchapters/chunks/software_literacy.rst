Software literacy
=================

(usual intro) then 

Another introduction
--------------------

This book is based around a single axiom : That computer software is a new form of literacy.  I want you, dear reader, to accept this as it is the basis for all going forward.  It is a little hard to take such things on faith, but a few nudges might help.

Firstly one that threw me completely- did you know that the walls of Jericho were thirty feet high almost 2000 years before writing was invented?  You see writing is a form of technology - it needed to be invented, supported.  Humans were building structures, humans were *engineering* walls, and building machines to help undermine or assault those walls) for 20 centuries before 
they thought to write about it.

Secondly, 

we already have AI - the crowd, the group, the organisation, the state - it's just slow and hard to introspect



Software development 
--------------------

I think writing is an excellent metaphor for software development 

- well defined outocomes 
"a novel"?
"a love story"
"chapter 13 needs to be about the break up"


this is not how we write stories - it might work for encyclopaedia but a book is a book not a collaborative work 

we don't have perfect metaphors - but we didn't for writing in 2000bc or even 0bc
