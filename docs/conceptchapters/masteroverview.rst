  If everyone is literate what can change about the company? why is it different
  
- Doubling down on democracy
Hypocrisy and "doubling down on democracy"

The pg idea that we should not stop entrepreneurs from building the new land - that this is what makes america vibrant misses a big part of the story

Getting to the top, when using / exploring others is what we complain about in other less democratic societies

It is not about winning at all costs, it is not about winning for my side.  The insidious part of pg argument is that it is not racist or sexist - it is power-ist- it is those who have power deserve to have power irrespective of how they got it.

airbnb cheated. paypal cheated uber cheated.  And won.  they did nit murder or bomb or gas.  It was not that bad.  But it wouldn't it stand up in court

it's hypocrisy 

democracy sits in a spectrum - every dictator in their high castle still must pay attention to the mob

and we are not on the far end of that spectrum 


150 years ago america paid bounties on native american scalps, 75 years ago state sponsored terrorists in white hoods, often employed by police departments, used violence to prevent blacks from voting, today children are ripped from their mothers arms as they cross borders abs thrown into jail

no. Doubling down on democracy is  not just carrying on as we are. it is living up to these ideals

and building new companies is not just carrying on cheating as we are, leaning on the systemic injustices to allow some people achieve power more easily

building new companies means changing more than the algorithms in the CRM.  New enterprises need to change at a software level - and at a deep organisational level

- swardley maps, coase and 
  org design

- model monitor mentor 


- maps and war games - org design and eco systems - coase

- social media - lots to discuss but it's not one thing - mixing publishing and printing and feed selection and discovery - also moderator problem is really not a problem for facebook - it's that we published every conversation in every pub in the world.  This really is an education issue


- moop - how to be better ...

- education - mastery learning as a basis - means learning via computers - but also
implies moop and other areas (ie better financial sense) 






- regulation morality and software - everything requires upfront design including moral decisions - how does democracy handle the trolley problem
see the covid decision process in number 10 - clearly sub optimal - it's that each decision must be made in assumption  it's going to be shown how it was made - so make the org do it that way anyway - the org infrastructure (civil service - model monitor mentor) is there while the policy decisions are human

- is it all in the model? No but we must talk models - software again - good software modelling languages 

- alternate history and modelling - it's about how facts change but the system rolls on

- transparency in decision making (it's really really hard !!!) - is going to be one of democracy finest solutions - but this is about

- evolution of organisations (local maxima is one boss in charge - can see that failing at number 10)

- hardware and software security
https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/57199.html

- big changes
start with Yes Prine minister and that nothing changes - see brexit trump wage stagnation
These political big changes are around societal organisations  - and the big change recently has been software and hardware enabled - and all the coming changes will be in software - we all need a software mind 


- different organisation types 

Dr Ola Johannson, Professor of Geography at the University of Pittsburgh explains that Sweden has a culture of collaboration, which plays into its vibrant music scene. “Swedish organisations beyond the music industry are known to have what we call a ‘flat decision-making structure’ where everybody participates equally, whether you are the boss or not. I think for song-writing, that type of social model turned out to be very useful.” Ola suggests that this approach has its roots in the social democratic project of the 20th Century, which spans far wider than the music industry. “It has reshaped Swedish culture in many different ways. For example, it is customary in Sweden to talk to everybody using the first name, there’s no Mr or Sir – beyond maybe the King.”

brands are only way to overcome market for lemons - so education as a marketing strategy is sensible - see patio11


- constitutions as an org principle - they are contracts with the people entering age of total hybrid (army navy ie expensive) war - see Athens and salamis or napoleonic era

we shall see constituents in companies - and so end of politically neutral companies ? 

or end of immortal companies? faster turnaround ? faster return of capital to other uses? 

- legal-economic singularity : Ataomenpoint there will exist a model of an economy that allows predictive action - that you can roughly predict effects of legal changes / policy.  At which point everyone will refer to it when passing laws - the ultimate techno-cracy 
see also software written as laws, laws was software, business process, post office pretending software was correct and internal to business - managing the business processes - director hazing

Privacy vs secrecy vs normal

- software literacy and developers
with rayan was easier to explain which piece of code to change than use english ! 
- Foss
"FOSS developers are living in the future - and the friction comes from a world that works by different set of rules" - zx2391 on HN

Follow the young - no follow the software literate.  This idea of giving away for free trillions of dollars of value is ... Star Trek. follow that future 

- death of project management : 
Think 1950s. you had one person gonna collect the state of many activities. they then became obvious point for authority about change from above / redirection of resources

but now that's a automated status reporting - so any resource allocation decisions can be made but who do they affect?  1. you need a model (see apple and their todo list) but two it's a flatter structure

It's not about communication - it's about organising

We see internet as communication medium - it is and we see ends of platforms in mobiles
yes 

but steam engines 

but it's about how we organise work - that makes it more efficient t 
- it's coase
it's ledgers
it's programmable companies 
it's model mentor etc
it's putting the computer back into productivity statistics 

it's a big uphill road - but the point is it's uphill

Literacy
--------

It's all about developer productivity - note pad and pen.

Software eats the world
-----------------------
https://erikbern.com/2020/12/16/giving-more-tools-to-software-engineers-the-reorganization-of-the-factory.html

a good description of this issue

Economic rent problem and housing
-----//--
https://youtu.be/niUsivEtAls

not sure why it's software related other than picketty 

Actually it's a history story:  Agricuktural rent - housing rent to robot rent? Where is the wealth stored and where is it generated? 
rent is a problem with distribution of wealth - and UBI and other regulatory solutions do not use the power of decentralised markets and prices (which we like for efficiency)

Housing

Going up because we don't build enough houses - partlty - but mostly due to increase in credit supply chasing houses

problem with modern monetary theory (money supply should equal production levels) is economic rent - extraction of money for no value- which makes hard to measure 


Future of google 
----------------
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26887451

Basically will they reveal their algorithm - are they promoting sites that provide advertising feeds



Why agile is appealing
-----------------------

I don't like management 
it's about squidgy people

but also it's about defining what those peoples roles are abs training them and setting levels and so on - but that's a lot easier with code - so why not replace people 


Price mechanism
and decentralised control 
and maybe diner thing else?
- is internet all humans to humans comma - is it possible that can replace price mechanism? 

Also people I don't like and why their ideas piblically states seem good - farafe and cummings

garage - just what was obvious 30 years ago - walk through UK issues

cummings - what is coming - more concerned - different choices? 


Better Os 
---------
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security
The point here is lacking transferable capability security we ended up with virtualisation solving this problem (plus others like multi tenancy).

plus others like run this exactly 


Democracy 
---------
Double down on democracy
- take detour to discuss Joseph schumpeter - he saw democracy not as a ideal in itself but as a method to discover what the people want - and the current democracy is not ideal
for that - so there can be a lot of experimentation 


One Inwoukd like to see is common now in project mgmt - rank ordering.  It is slowly entering program management - and it is hitting the ceiling of politics - if you rank order by the people, the resource allocation decisions are made by default and as such why have management / executives

But we could see new companies springing up - smaller companies and as such anoento select on their values systems - 

The flaw in the problem of ignorance. We don't need well informed electorates beyond a certain point - we can allow the market to find the efficient means to deliver a desired goal.  We just need to know enough to decide the stack ranking of each market - we need to understand the ramifications of prioritising climate co2 reduction against say the farming industry

See each market as a cell in larger host - and the democracy decision is what (minimal) regulations to use to put the desired relative weights of one against the other 


Schumpeter sees democracy as a completion between different "manifestos" of the political class - the one with the best persuasion wins. He explicitly links it to advertising 

But, looking at the cambridge analytics scandal and the problems - there is a correlation / causation problem.  Simply having slick advertising or 

You can poison the well, ala negative campaigning - but then who drinks from a poisoned well. 

You cannot tell who we are from our likes, and even if youndid get enough data to map us, i doubt you could craft a precise target ad more effective than "save the whales" or just "have some tax rebates".  Much like MKUltra the old standbys of bribery and threats will work just as well. (cf google va duck duck go)


And you cannot be all things to all people as your opponent will delight in pointing out your inconsistencies - we are in a competence market after all 



We are not so easily fooled.  Is the simple answer - human brains grew large it seems to deal with the problems of politics and game theory as tribal sizes grew.


Maps abs war gaming
-------------------
Use war gaming as a means to handle large scale organisational decisions and problems - agree a model (model mentor monitor) and see where we get to 

- organisational planning - model monitor mentor and use swardley maps and war gaming and probabilities to decide best / most likely safe course ? 

Organisational design as a future strength for humanity 


We are not so easily fooled
---------------------------
New forms of democracy
Brexit and trump and five star - all voted for with eyes open by adults.
Might not like it but it's real.

universal morality 
------------------
It's not universal morality 
it's more globalised regulation means we shall have to "align" our laws etc and a lot of that will be aligning our moral stories - this will almost always be a ratchet up effect - we shall choose the best globally 


Political entrepreneurship
--------------------------

Just as we think all the choices have gone, there is a political entrepreneur waiting to sell us more - beach left right ice cream and uk politics - new options, new sales

Is waiting for a manifesto correct? What about voting out / in executives in corporations? 

It's next obvious step.

What about using rank ordered policies ? 

Programmable company still needs men's rea or it will just be an AI seeking goals (paperclip goop)


Programmable company : coherent organisational mind coded in software - can be read and reviewed 
- cf Japanese armed forces in WWII - major reason they lost was massive rivalries in army and navy - only reason pulled together for midway was emprerors life was threatened by doolittle (cf twin towers) 





So we need an ideal, we need vision and political eneprshop - but we also need that to more quickly guide the faster moving programmable more agile company - companies are getting ahead of our morality - that is not a problem with morality - it is a problem of the speed of feedback

Democracy is the right feedback mechanism - and we need to find better faster ways to guide the AI towards its goals - rank ordering, executive replacement etc

Coase tells us we could get down to a one person mega firm, but schumpeter tells us we would just have that guided by nothing - so we need to insert democracy 

(schumpeter democracy is genuine competition between polictakn entrepreneurs offering different packages and asking for power) 


More democracy in companies has three implications

- equitable share of profit 
(vote for me for a pay rise)

- coherent policy (smaller company, break ups etc)
hard to sell a manifesto covering a giant conglomerate - tax issues etc will surface

- political neutrality will divide - but they are not neutral. won't people vote to lobby on some subjects not others? 


Possible future - 
- active shareholders exist - they try to enact a policy 

but what if they present an entirely new executive - CEO etc.

Then that is schumpeter democracy.  and as such it's a competition between political elites

And then what if the major blocks of votes, like black rock and pension funds, what if hey put web site up saying how do you want us to vote your 17 shares? 

Shareholders democracy ... what about employee democracy? Every employee becomes a shareholder? 

Do we do one share one vote or one person one vote? This is landowners vs commenters 
200 years ago it was obvious that landowners should vote for parliament because they owned all the shares (ie land) - but today it's one person one vote 



See the no 18 bus ride / recovery trial as "what you get when ask software mind to design a company"


The software mind is one where you have to hold all pieces in your head and design a way thorough - it is one of transparency and efficiency abs refactoring

- it's basically software needs things to be explicit - the assumptions etc.  And if it's not the software is insanely hard to write

and you cannot easily hide your biases ...

It's transparent abs auditable ....

Drivers co-operatives fighting back in the gig economy 
---------------------

see nyc drivers cooperative 
- cuts lyft and uber out of loop.

Bullshit ideas
--------------

Gig Economy : exploring the workers with software

Rental economy : it's only more efficient until demand exceeds supply, then it's prices rocketing up - owning items like snow shovels is a form of price stability hedging


Shape of future society
-----------------------

Firstly we can start with basics - 4biloikn smartphones we are all connected.  how does this shake out?
covid - we are not nations but one biosphere
- so are  atkins a useful idea? Common regulation - uber and amazon 
The EU and the african thing - future hope of society

But let's look at moop- it's where this stuff goes

but look at the obvious one - medicine. what lifestyle is most healthy.  This ooos an easy one - e felt look at Russia - life expectancy of 65 (pension age 66). Will the medical advice from epidemiology be "don't live under a mid-income dictatorship?"

the answer for western democracies - double down on democracy - look at EU look at thaler and libertarian xxx - look at sensible defaults - look at agents that actually work on our behalf 

MOOPs is the collection of data.

Agents acting in the best interests of user is the *advi e* based in the mass collection of data.

The next Larry Hagman in Dallas won't be actor pretending to be happy  - but will be a digital champagne socialist - sharing wealth of a country and not exploited by corporations and others - but aware and trading i off - the end of caveat emptor 

Other implications
- mesh networking will become a NSA funded thing - like TOR designed to undermine dictatorships.  it's probably the one most effective thing - but it will also allow fake news to spread.

so we need to find ways to inoculate society - and that's still a great great challenge - mostly relying on the common sense of most people. 
it's not that bad an idea? children a/ education 
Idea: alternative history gives interesting way to validate my mental models of democracy against yours - if we arrive at same society we have same operating models - and really that's what we care about in a democracy - shared oersting models

and guess what software is good at?

Search is crap now
------------------
https://sparktoro.com/blog/in-2020-two-thirds-of-google-searches-ended-without-a-click/

- It's so easy to spam with words now that it's more or less reached the point where google cannot tell difference between a valuable blog post by an expert and SEO manufactured rubbish


- So they keep you on site (sort of like a vast encyclopaedia)

- or you bounce to high trust curated sites (stack overflow) (NB - all props to Joel but once again labour is not rewarded equal to the value created - those are *unpaid* moderators making the site valuable.

- So there needs to be a cost in production of the content - youtube for example - want to see how to lay laminate floor, well you need to have a camera and a person and he'll a room with laminate flooring needed - that's a big cost. Lowes has made a video, so have dozens of contractors.  It's amazing how tool rental firms have not advertised on there ... actually that is a bit weird

Search quality is crap

Search is however the (only) way to reach people? Isn't it?

relevant Content on high production cost platforms.



- how will the changes in tech (smartphone device, 
walk through all
 - legal / regulation - business model for tech - ) change the society (cities transport education etc)
 
 
- sensor collection and moop
- privacy vs who is allowed to use it for what purpose 
- what is facebook - it is ideal demographic breakdown machine 
- where will data be stored and where will code run and ow will the two be logged - this is basically the important part.  data colours

The open source quandary
------------------------
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25896351

- essentially OSS circumvents the gatekeeper of purchase orders - so we end up using code with odd licenses and no one knows when where (ie npm)

- redhat has the right approach and I expect this to expand - there will be curated open source companies supplying not just licensed code with verified supply chains but also expertise


 
 at least sensible second order effects

Double down on democracy
------------------------

Brexit (putting wish fulfilment before facts / which textbooks you read as a schoolchild)

also internal politics of a company are almost entirely non-market (patronage society)
patronage bad way to run society - see "get colonised by the british"

Most companies internally are still in 1980s digital - and looking to advance - imagine a world where we say "look at that market opportunity - i should take over the invoicing dept by being more efficient han them"
