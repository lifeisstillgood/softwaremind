Web 3.0 fanboys
---------------

I have (amazingly) been in industry through both web 1 and 2.  And failed to make billions which I am fairly sore about.  But now I can make my billions - in web 3.0

Let's unpick some of the (over)hype and see what we think is coming down the line and might for the basis of the meta verse / web 3 / whatever 



Good coverage: https://permission.io/blog/web-3-0/

Basics

- content addressable file system (ie IPFS).
- blockchain ledger for supply chain mgmt
- semantic data (see w3c / TBL)
- strong digital identities
- bots and 

maybes 

- micropayments and currency (but i bet in fiat cryptocurrency - so BoE runs the UKP blockchain, at millions of blocks a day)

- smart contracts 
I am negative on this. Just like reversing transactions is a feature not a bug, law courts are a feature of contracts not a bug.

I completely agree that a piece of software that is *part* of a legal contract - modelling it for example - can vastly improve understanding and analysis. Completely replacing hundreds of years of legal development seems like overkill.

- server less computing - code can be picked up and run where abs when ever - and with IPFS data *might* be close.  There is a hell of a lot sub-optimised with this idea - but it is attractive for most things most businesses want most of the time.  My guess is that the ratio is about as often as you need to drop to C for python work.  it has that "feel".  And often most people don't notice they are dropping to C (pandas) - so likely that for some things (touching a data pool) gets queued in servers in a given data centre. 

- bots
Hell yes.

- AI 
like SQL

- ubiquitous connectivity

- 3D immersion
It seems an add on, not a necessity.  But damn it's cool.
