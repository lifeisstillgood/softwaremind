Software Governance
===================

If more than one person works together for a commonnaim, thise people need a means of agreeing, a way to build consensus.  It might be "strong man" dictatorship or a hippie commune, but every organisation needs a form of "governance" - and this applies to what software will be written, and what thatvsoftware will so

As software eats the world, and companies become programmable companies, we need methids to decide what software to write, and how that software will behave, which will dirext how the organisation behaves.

This is goverance.  Partly project managenebt, partly democracy, all politics.

Theory of governance

All governance is consensus, all governance is trade off, all governance is politics, democracy needs institutions and norms, 

We live in very young democracies, and work in dictatorships.  We shall find new ways to open dictatorships to voting, democratic institutions and better stewardship over the resources franted the orovate secotr.

(its why I am despite my liberal leanings not a big government person - a democratic instituion trying to regulate inherently dictators is foolish - regieme change leading to dmeocratic institions. )

Make policies explicit and auditable 

Multi dimensional Software
--------------------------

Thisnis anothe rif those "mishy" concepts I am still working on but it feels valuable.

Software can have multiple dimensions to operate in.  The simplest, and most constrictive is one-dimensional.  A spreadsheet is one dimensional most of the time.  Simple if, then, else statements. Most of the time we will refer to this as "hardcoded" or "special case".  Its code that looks like

if reportname=="foo":
   header="my title"
   
There is nothing *wrong* with this, it works and does the job.  But its hard

And I am most definitely not arguing for factory classes or setters and getters.  That is putting clever code structires before clever data steuxtures.  Get your data structurws right first. A good data structure can have very dumb code but code has to do a lot of heavy lifting to compensate for the wrong data structure.

There just is no room to stand up.

Somwe look for a second dimension.  This dimension is data strictire.  Probably pukling report defintions of of lines of code and pitting in config.
Or chnaging the data structure to make it easier to achieve your *opinion* or *software theiry* (see programming as theory - ie opinionated software)

Third dimension is explixit policiy engine - the oponion is inherent in data structure and code - and now the levers in the opinion can be explictly extracted and altered and even seperately modelled.


aoftware as capital
software that depreciates slowly and provides ongoing value.  Do not trwat it as lego, it is an ecosystem and it grows and needs to be inderstood - "fits in one brain".

Opinionated Software
--------------------
Must have a theory - why blank canvas enterprise software is so hard to use - trying to accomodate any idiotic purchasing managers coew if what might ne needed means having all opinions - ans like the Increibles quote, no opinion.

So programming as theory building - means company needs to have a clear theory of its own actocites. And so needs to express those theiries in the data structires and code chooces each time.
So the programmars need to understand those theories to be able to express them (codenis the design) thus making them the managers of the work

But also it means making the implicit explicit. this is VW engine liability - but simpler idea is explanation frommposcast The Rest Is Politics.

One co-host (Rory Stewart) explained a time when a newspaper printed a factually incorrect accusation that he (Rory) had been having an affair with his Secretary.  The woman involved was obviously embarrassed as was Rory and Rory wanted to put out a public denial.  But Rory's political party office opposed this - saying "it wont donyounany good, will draw attention to the issue".  Rory Asked his cohost for any insights - and Alistair Campbell a highly expeirenced "political operator" explained that the reason (all) party offices oppose such things is not that it will be bad for the falsely accused politician, its that of all the falsely accused politicians publically denied such things, then only the ones who coukd not issue a (truthful) denial would be left high and dry. 

Rory then laughed and pointed out he had issues such a denial and the whole thing had gone away. 

The long winded point is that all the software in the world can say "minimise public denials". But at some point you have to code up "turn off the engine when a test is being run"
