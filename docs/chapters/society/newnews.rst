Micro transactions and the market for lemons
========

Micro transactions have been heralded as the next big thing for 20 years. (cf clay shirky).
the problem is that the technology has always been there - what is hard to overcome is the market for lemons.

I have a subscription to The Guardiana nd the Economist, These are periodicals of repute and i am confidence that they will over the next 12 months produce articles and insights i wish to read / listen to.
But, and it's a big bit, i am not confidence that every article they write will be worth reading. in fact i am pretty sure not.

so my problem becomes how can i decide before reading the article, if it is worth a non zero amount of money to read

I cannot tell - there is information asymmetry - and it is like buying a second hand car - the article could be Pulitzer quality or Putrid. I don't know and just have to put down my money. I do t want to take that risk and so would rather spend a subscription.

A similar argument is seen if my time is the micro transactions  (moneified by ads) - and this time we see the race to the bottom as good second hand cars are withdrawn from the market (and good articles vanish and replaced by click bait)
