=======================
The Architect's Paradox
=======================

An architect today can <design> a building, but leave many of the detaisl to be worked out at construction time (they of course need to ensure load bearing floors etc etc. But often this not work out - see NEw York famous.) But imagine we create a robot that injects concrete exactly where its told. At this point te architect can churn out hundreds of buildings at a time, but they need to specify *everytrhing*.  This is the problem, opportunity and promise of software as it eats the world - vast savings, vast control, but now everything must be much more explicit.
