Financial Balances - since everything is a transaction, total income must equal total expenditure (as long as you count lets saybthebwhole economy )

So if we look at Domestic private (households and factories etc) - they can spend a certain amount and recive (salary, revenue) a certain amount. That might be a psotive balance (more salary than expensese) or negative but it is a balance somewhere

Same for government - spending and taxation.

And same for trade we sell
more goods then we buy or not

So if youbare workshop of the worlde you can run a trade surplus (more coming in) and then the other two parts (private and government) can "save" (invest in infrastruxture)


Issue is hiw to create enough money to match productive capacity of country - and to choose the productive capacity types ? War productionshows this can work amazingly effecticeky

but banks might not be the best approach - see freddie mac not giving blackmpeoole loans 

so how to measure productive capavity? how tonmeasure chnages in capacity? How to guide chnages in way you want - welcome to politics
