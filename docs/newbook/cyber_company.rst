  robotics struggles because realmworld is hard
  humans have a model of the world developed ocer years
  AI tries
  education and science improces thatbmodel
  organisations live in legally mediated workd
  so models and assumptions about world can be 
  extracted made explicit - and shareable 
  SOPpy - see featiee files and regex descriotions
  if this then that - will not work all time but when it does value is immense
  we now seem to be at tippingnpoont where 
  enough point solutions exist that whole org can be 
  good enough repaced and will be quality dofference 
  each org needs a black box called "perception" - what is going on
  internally and externally, from that they can extract and cia policy 
  workmout their decisions - this is a robotics concern
  and we can reasonakly assume organisations are business rbotos
    
  so treat an org like a robot - it is seen as a person but bow it needs to 
  be a robot - "perceptiom and funding" https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39707943

MOOp / surveillance
everything we do each day leaves a digital
footprint. software can tracknthat and use it
as oart if whole org test rig to determine
the project management parts - if innany circumstance. a
person who does the work has to also
uodate some system, then its a joke.
follow the dogitla footprints
and so most of project mamagenrnt is useless
planning the work is about designing the work
and building the tests - neother of whichnsoftware illterate pronect managers can fo

Theory of firm - Coase
=======================

why are some companies big - because they can aborb capital
in defined way
banks
real estate (mcdinalds starbucks)
commodity producers of high capital goods - steel, coal, not coffee or bananas
with some variation on regulatory politxsl capture
pirchase servivrs in market
but knowledge work will never have
such high capital cost (AI?)
foss drives down like literacy
only the writing we rely on - and only one law
so its opennrss about product and location (ledgers)
that will drive next eave of cheapness
that and robotic production, distribution
aggregation not innovation???
SOme concepts:
* Coase - why are firms not tiny and use market for co-ordiantion
* Chandler - similar question - plus "iron law of bureaucracy"
Economic Scale has built "the state" and the "miliary" and has built "para-state"
companies
(banks, utilities, major commodity production like steel, pharma)
But these are *built* like militaries are - for a particular purpose.
When they no longer fit the purpose they have to be rebuilt.
But their structure (and management) will create inertia (resistence)
Its not as malicious as perhaps chandler sees - most manager see the way the
wind is blowing, and looks to position themselves.  But it is not market
competition.
THe too big to fail problem
But can programabnle company offer a new answer - by allowing
* clear SOP changes
* whole org test rigs to allow modelling, faster feedback etc.
* robotic self view - whole org test, but also perception, feedback, actions
* openness - i mean why was it so long for nayone to see the big short?

The programmable company
=================================

Programming is theory buikding
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40103407
Startups are theiry building
Essentially knowledge work is expressions of theorues
software and sop are expressions of theory of MVP
or product market fit
software is a net - manufacturing is the bits of holes
software cannot fill.
the point is AI cannot know what comes next - thats a theory
Two things make a robot work. Perception and funding.
What is difference between a literate company, and a programmable company?
* There is a code / English tipping point.
  Spend anytime in large companies, especially heavily regulated, and you will
  find there is a *enormous* amount of effort put into *explaining* code changes
  in English (or Japanese or German etc).
  At a certain point it is simpler, quicker and easier to read the darn code
  to find out what it does and is meant to do.
  "but surely, you need to have a design, to have a set of requirements. THese
  need to be written down in English.".
  Yeah kind of.  Its more like "Artistis improession" drawings for buildings.
  Its a guide sure. but even blueprints are not on the ground reality.
  Plus I mean have you read some laws - they are horribly drafted.  Which is why
  we end up with judges trying to interpret the law to make some sense.
  Anyhow.  Trying to change a codebase using ENglish is wrong. Trying to
  change a code base using forward plans is also .. wrong.  Planning is
  not how one builds a novel.  Writing is.  Wriitng is differnt.
* There is a direct data flow penetrating the 2(O) layers, top to bottom.
* Openness.  This is a *assumption* of mine - see Democratic Bet.  But,
  look I have worked in companies large and small, and seen codebases treated
  many different ways.  The places where it is *trivial* to grep a codebase
  find something interesting and reach out to the developer and just ask
  always seems to have ... more fluidity and movement. And thats a really simple
  problem.
management as puppeteer vs management as operating system designers
too much executive hero actuons is puppeteering
and its not aboutnhiring great people for fucks sake
everyone works they cant all be great
the industrial revolutionnwas about replacing a process of making great craftspeople
through apprenticeships
and making a fucking great loom that always got it right
Companies are known as "corporatations".  THis is they are supposed to be
like a *human body*. Humans have near-continuous feedback from sensors
through out the body, providing the brain with uptodate ... oh you know
what a body is.
And pretty much every harried executive knows that companies are nothing
like that. None of them know where the next fire they have to fight is
going to come from. Trying to get consistent infomration *that has not been
manually massaged and adjusted* is impossible.
We lack sensors to observe what is happening, lack pipes to transmit
that information, lack a model of the operations to populate with the data, and
compare to an expected operation, and as for turning round and giving
instructions that will be carried out ... forget it.
Ok maybe there is a little bit of the Office in there, but all companies
large and medium suffer from most of these problems.  THe small ones are
easier to manage but tend to go bust.
If we were to treat the corporation as a robot.
But it is a self-repairing robot. A robot where the self reapiring mechanism
is also trying to figure out how to make the robot more *its* way.
So we want to split out our model
* a versioned company, running one version of the 'Company OS', using SOP,
* a self-repair mechanims (change) that is fighting to acquire more of robot for
  itself
* many versions of data sensors, data pipes, operating model, SOP updates.
* a running version of the above version, in test rig, showing what will happen
  with certain changes.
THe self repair mechasnism can therefore be pointed at the test rig first,
and by having new versions play against recorded production, its possible to
backtest changes.
Oh and most companies are really lots of robots living togeher sharing a single
treasury.
This might get complicated.
AI is sweeping in now. It is being gifted almost magical powers to solve this
problem - but if AI can perhaps solve your issues, then you can solve them
anyway, today, with normal software.
We have covered some ground so its worth a recap
There is a great movie moment in
the film "The rainmaker" where matt Damon
has found the incriminating extra paragrpahs of
the dodgy insurance companies policy manual,
and he makes Roy Schneider read out the
but where the insurance company wont pay out
unless they get a solicitors letter, this rejecting
anyone not "lawyering up"
Today such dramtic moments would be ruined
by reading out Java code.
But the point woukd be that someone had to write
the dodgy policy manual, ans someone would have to
write the dodgy Java code.
Now an interesting thought experiment woukd be
"what if there was a differnce between the policy manual
and the code?" which one sends Roy Schneider to jail?
As software eats the world, my conjecture is that it is
yiurbdaily practise not your avowed intentions that will send you tonjail
(imagine a world where the isnurance GUI sends out refusal letters while the policy manual
says "we always treat our customerrs fairly)
so we can say "the code is the design" as the previous chapter argues
Now heres another question. If Roy schneider can read English
but cannot read Java code, is he immune from prosecution?
No. but perhaos equally he shoukdnnot be the CEO.

Tickets and accounting
----------------------

Tickets have three functions
- to post-hoc justify expenditure
- to forward plan change / effort
- to group different effort together
These can conflict in unusual ways
1. why are only coders expected to link
work to activity? Partly beciase we *can*
but it is a good question. everyone working on
a forward chnage project can allocate their time
(lawyers do). and the more
2. forward planning is ... not great.
we look at the 2(O) problem - no-one outside if
the 2 orders will be able to / likely to dive into and stay in details
so .... you are financing outcomes. Best to set automateable gateways
3. effort grouping is post-hoc.
suggestions:
sub-ticketing (ie JIRA-1234-a)
the problem of "is this ticket done?"
as opposed to "is the code good to release".
whole org test rigs.
Ticketing is a milestone on the way to progrmmable
company - if X% of people link their work to
tickets, there is a tippijg ooint.
the simplest isea is put [JIRA-1234] in subject lines.
But its hard ! yes but we can enforce it with pre-commit hook
Yeah.
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38625907
It's not so much "not JIRA", it's that managing code bases outside of the code base is
hard and awkward. And due respect to fossil-scm, I don't know if any way to do it
otherwise.
The goal here is to look at something that tells an organisation why chnages to a codebase
occurred. Each individual commit can have a nice explanation (in a given human language)
of why that specific change occurred. But how does one link other commits, dozens or
hundreds or orders of magnitude more.
Can they be accounted for to investors, auditors, regulators?
But equally demanding that commits link to something that links to why, it demands that
the rest of the business also link to that something (ie JIRA) so they can explain why
they expended time and effort
JIRA or whatever ticketing system, will slowly become the central repository of
justification for expense - a great position sure, but also dangerous.
Following on, having some repository of why - of cost drivers - forces not just the
software developers but the whole business to justify its activity against the repository.
This seems hugely similar to lawyers billing by the 15 minute increment, and indeed a git
repo will provide good billing like data too !
But the issue still exists - if I say my activity links to ticket number 1234, then we
have a hierarchy (?) of what 1234 links to. The smacks of stories and epics and the whole
agile package, but is also a common accounting process
my issue is that this is a neat, backwards looking explanation for what was done. It's not
a good way to manage forwards.
And often I find the problem is people wanting to use JIRAs tickets to manage what will be
done, not account for what has been done

Why the need to reinvent the commit message? Look at how Linux does it. If it's good
enough for a globally distributed organization creating the operating system the cloud and
most phones run on, it can't be completely wrong. They rely solely on mail and commit
messages.
Ticketing systems are useful for a lot of other things such as keeping track of work on an
individual level, or managing project resource allocations on a company wide level, but
I'm not sure it's the best tool to do audits and have accountability. It will at best be a
secondary source of that data.

And the Linux mailing lists are a great example of what I mean - deciding what to do and
why is a huge upfront discussion - one they do in the open. but it's a crap backwards
looking method for a summary.
Most businesses hide the upfront discussion (or at least keep it to a smaller set of
people who have often conflicting incentives for decisions as well (we tend to refer to
this as politics but that's a bit like fish moaning about water.)
Anyway the point is that Linux shows how to make good decisions in the open (usually) - a
process that I think most would 10x good decision making in most businesses but also lead
to huge other sets of problems (worth it in my view but ...).
But Linux does not have a simple way of post-hoc justifying the decisions unless one reads
the threads (which is where the recent post of open source journalist at lwn was a great
idea)
But things like Jira, external ticket stores are good at providing a hierarchy to post hoc
justify the decision - even if they are a terrible way to plan forwards.
So the ideal I guess is some kind of open architecture discussion upfront and some kind of
extract and rebuild the rationale from commits (ie in house journalism?)

  Totalitarina bet, Wealth inequality, feudal society,

  We are approcahing the slow down of the s-curve of the industrial
  revolution.  Energy was the *whole ball game* and it allowed a unique
  period of time where equality changed (see Pikkety)
  Now the wealth / power elites want to reassert themselves.
  Its a issue of deomraccy - equal say implies equal share.
  but democracy also has a societal benefit - the Totalitarian Bet.
  The property owning Middle class (unable to live on its own assets but have
  sufficeint assest to cushion lifetimes of blows, hence social insurance
  increases the middle class by minimising knick out blows)

A better test rig is orders magnitude more effective than “better communication”
Once a complete prod-parallel environment exists, any management question is answerable
directly through exploratory code chnage.
Major chnages (1.x 2.x) can presumably use the same real life feed, see Tesla data
advantage.
see Brooks law.
that management is disaggregated and the communication
value is much much lower
also primary skill set is learning
that is the provle we have is one we have never seen before
in this configuretion
so gonaway learn prqxtise and then come back and fix
its not a 9-5 job - its a consuktancy
so the idea of agile or management or bums on seats is ... off - end of industrialisation
(see my favourite door in London, and the need for knowledge workers, like lawyers)
Other management issues
model monitor mentor, internal homestasis of org, whilst meeting external
needs - politics of status quo and guesstimate changes.
If the communication is gone, if model monitor are better done by software, of process is
better done by software, then what we have left is internal homeostasis
Or politics (which will be disrupted by democracy as feudal politics was disrupted - and
its the middle class that rebel always)
Mentoring becomes a profession - a profession that is impossible to hold back to a few
It’s a fiat chance that we will find lawyer like prosfessions where they will have a
commit bit for the big software - laws, the software for gov depts

A fantastic idea, and also the philosophy behind Oberon is something I think we shall need
more of - as the operating system for a computer is now conceptually the operating system
for a network, a cluster of computers, for an organisation, a government, having one
company’s “operating system” not only be defined in software, but enable that software to
fit in one head, that seems important in ways that otherwise make us throw up our hands
and say “it’s all rigged” or “they are all the same” or “who knows, let’s just keep going”
