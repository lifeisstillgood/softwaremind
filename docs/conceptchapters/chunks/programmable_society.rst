China's Totalitarian Bet
========================

So of course when I say China i don't mean the 1.5 billion people living there, working hard and raising kids (or being kids).  I of course am talking about the few thousand  top politicians / generals who constitute the "administration".  just keep that in mind 

So this concept Inoriignally heard from John McNaughton of the Guardian.  So there is a meme that is / has been doing the rounds.  It's a little but Ra-Ra for Freedom and democracy (which I am also a little but Ra-Ra for, at least when I am in a Ra-Ra mood.  Which is less often than the chief cheerleader for the Texas something something football team, but is a reasonable level of Ra-Ra for a middle aged Brit)

Anyway the idea is that democracy and freedom means that when it comes to our armed forces 

a totalitarian society wants to control all aspects of that society (total control is kinda in the name).  And that control has issues - it's not impossible but it requires incredible amounts of data from the "edges" coming back to the centre, and it requires incredible amounts of processing to attend to abs sort all that data, and it requires effective (correct) decision making at the centre. 

Chinas bet is that they now, in the age of the iPhone
they now have the first two - enough data can be collected and enough clever algorithms can be applied (read ML) to find the important data.  And as for the third - making the right decisions - well ... everyone thinks they have that down pat anyway.

So Chinas bet is they can run a totalitarian society now.  Unfortunately there is no 'a priori' reason they are wrong.  I mean humans are pretty much a herd animal and tend to follow along for social group 
cohesion for more than we should.

Our bet, and by us Inmean the Ra-Ra freedom loving people of "Western civilisation", our bet is of course that they are wrong 

But then the corollary to that is that democracy, freedom, decentralised decision making is better.  

But we need to balance that ideological with a pragmatic recognition of the need for regulation - that market structures are created and regulated.  It is all a trade off but a trade off with 

China does not trust the owners of vast companies to make the best decisions - and they want to keep a tight leash on all such decisin s

A western liberal strawman does not trust those same owners - and wants to have transparency, openness, regulation and universal suffrage as the means to keep a tight leash on things.

There is a difference
