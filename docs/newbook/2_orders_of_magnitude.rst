Organisations and Scale
=======================

Humans have a challenge. Human brains are more or less optimised for handling a small tribe of people - a dozen or two, maybe up to the Dunbar Number of 150.  More than that and we forget or get confused or cannot work out who is family.  This is why celbritoes and politicians want to be your father or mother figure. so you remeber who the f**k they are.

The problem is there are 8 billion people.

Organising at scale is a problem.  We have tried to successively solve it. Religion, agricultire, education, kings, empires, military. Nation states. Science.

Science worked. mostly.

But its not merely building a single organisation that does a single thing.  Militaries have managed that.  Its building a single orgnaisaiton that can then change.  Pivot. 

We really suck at that. Name a government department. You know one. The UK Post Office is a pertinatn exmaple right now.  How do you come in with a new broom on that one.


Organisaing software in the small
----------------------------------

Film making as a metaphor.

Tech lead - I dont maange people I manage code (Linus Torvalds)
(?)       - Producer. Solving problems you did not know existed.
(?)       - Manager - building systems that solve problem before the producer encoutners them

also - film making as a metaphor

single director single work 
but still director has many people but can be there 

but CGI is lotsnif film scenes done bu different artists so making coherent whole kichbharder - use if pre viz etc 


2 Orders of magnitude
---------------------

A way of thinking of responsibility outlines 

How do we organise.
Getting data structures right in software matters.
Getting human structures also matters.
When does my detail becaome your abstraction

Abstraction cut off layers.
