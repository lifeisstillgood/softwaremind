Literacy

Programmable has an extra literacy issue - as well as sounding like you know what a subject is about, code actually has to work - further increasingly likelihood the coder understands the subject - welcome to the antidote to fake news 

society needs to agree on base facts, and then agree on a model through which to process those facts

this is the fake news problem - there is some disagreement on what is a fact, but mostly it is what facts are important - which is how are our models built - what facts do they use to trigger our concerns 

Explicit models may help here - certainly an option for people to have examinations models as manifestos

programmable company / society / people

View on internet and programming 

Tech has confused / conflated programming and internet companies - internet companies like facebook and google have populated a new space called the internet - like radio and tv companies populated a new industry 

But they are not exclusive to programming - that has more change and growth to come - at a deeper lelvel 

Society: avoiding the middle income trap 

State was just for warfare then became possible to organise at scale (writing) and states had mass - now they had dependnscy on population and needed to keep it healthy etc

The middle income trap is hard to quantity - but shows a retreat of state control (directed central) ans towards aliases dairel - but is that true - is money spent in military industrial actually producing ROI ? 

States before 1600 were retinues of retinues so had serious opposition to mad kings.  slowly the beureauct centralised power - and literacy enabled such command and control

industrial revolution allowed for such growth and electronic communication allowed for totalitarianism - total control.

but we need 


Data Driven
-----------
Sounds good - but *getting* the data is the challengeZ

Look at the splintered company (lots languages and systems barely workijg together) (see army analogy - eventually you want to stop using special forces)

Most reporting systems are human mediated - not automated - in an enterprise - and that becomes Chinese reporting- making look good to your bosses - ultimately why a programmable company is desirable - it is transparent and so truth

only bad leaders really say "lie to me"

Publish data into a public sphere and allow people to collect it losslessly

trust that they will respect the colours assigned 


Once data is free code will be free too

A communal data access layer - PII data should be available

Web 2.0 is not the last internet epoch (see stratechery) - it was just a UI 

it's about access to data and formats - security yes but also just access - data should stay where it is and you ask to access it and cache it as needed 

append only caches are easy to keep 

So who owns data 

KYC becomes a mantra


Vulnerable do not need anonymity- they need not to be vulnerable / attacked

The DevManual
- next decade of coding
- better developer experience (writing the writing tools)cf git 

https://future.a16z.com/the-case-for-developer-experience/

Managing complexity of software os an organisation problem and is defining challenge - being able to change your org to accept softwares next challenges will define if you make it.  And pretty much no company that is not lead by a software literate leader will manage - and even those that are will suffer legacy problems 

- best way for a business to change is to build the new business and reverse itself in.  But then the goodwill is predicated on the prooor systems and structures 

Biggest issues

- how to own data across a company and control changes schemas 
- how to manage data types 
- data provenance 
- data colours 
- sharing common knowledge (code reviews,)

essentially only solutions are strong data typing, and consequentially approved data types.  you cannot define your own classes anymore.  Inwoukd say the end of object orientated and rise of functional data types (in other words you cannot have functions that work on data in the data type anymore) 



these are not "security"
issues - they are software issues 


freedom and democracy
---------------------
MOOP implies two approaches to the "centaur" for our daily lives.  A patients best interests approach - one of individual liberty enhanced with the lessons and learnings from epidemiology- and a totalitarian approach - a suppressive technology that tells everyone what to think abs not think.  How successful is that ? 

Will there always be a suppressive effect? Yes, Kim Kardashian is aaare she is being filmed.  But it's hard to say if she is hiding much ? And we will find options. holidays and breaks - bathroom breaks etc 

We must build our democracies with software not despite it, and build them as shining beacons - because they will hold us 

and we cannot avoid it.


Politics *follows* the people
----------------------
it's a wellnknown trite cliche politicians watch to see where people are going and shout follow me!

But this is and always been true - power flows from others *belief* that the powerful are powerful.  Violence xxx

Doing as told - study of german and japanese atrocities (and elsehqeee ) 

but we need better ways to extract people's actual desires and wants - twitter is *not* an effective polling on any constituency.

I believe that one of the great levelling forces in UK politics is that a prospective or sitting MP is obliged to knock on doors and say vote for me.  It is a ritual and tradition that forces face to face awareness (if not understanding or sympathy)

So besides MOOP something that forces us to a survey our population effectively - will be dangerous and valuable.

Electronic voting is impossible - but electocnic surveys is quite viable.  Great security risk is that of matching surveys to voters.

Open vs closed
--------------
Prior to wwBoth land was the determinant factor in productivity
This is not longer the case (solar, food (multinrise farming) and so war is less about territory than about captured trade partners 

- Britain forced trade 
- USA supported free trad
- so the future war will be less about land (although it always is) and more about supply chains 

Openness is a lodestone - open source and open supply chains (or open protocols) means flexibility 

As the belt and road tighten what can and cannot be sent on there will play an important part


Coase
-----
Writing organisations are small - even huge newspapers, outputting volumes are small compared  to almost any other major, influential company (WaPO - 800 staff writers, NYT - 1300 

So these ideas come into play:

- writers are mostly autonomous - they are given missions (assignments) not factory roles, and are expected to be creative within confines.  In other words do not do pre-planned execution but solve problems - this is a by product of "the code is the design"


- writers are expected to be heavily outward facing (customer contact) with heavy access to business data and metrics.

Yes data protection matters but imagine much less "commercial confidentiality" crap 

- Implications 
a growth of large conglomerates that have no business rationale but are there because the business is attractive and heavily software influenced and so the software friendly culture gives advantages 

Over a generation this will slow down and find lower coasian equilibrium - but it's probably a good idea to invest in companies that are software friendly - and no agile does not count
