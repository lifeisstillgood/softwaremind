But self organising sucks (structureless stuff like chiat day)
How to reward people? 

but anyway ... software 

Why need good managers ? to shield younfrom the politics and in foghting?

then the missing part is
democracy. you cannot get rid of politics - but you can 
remove the buts where individiulas are toompowerful 

Reward systems 
Video games teach us that regular frequent rewards are waay better than 
on off rewards. so why have annual appraisals - because having a manager there daily enabked daily approasals and reqard ( at least bu the good managers) 
So remotw work not somgood
having demos very good




Chapter: software is disaggeegating management 
===============================================

  - how do companies decide? 
    robotics useful 
    simple terms - OODA loop 
    observe is perception - collection of data
    orient is collating data into a model that 
    is an effective representation of reality 
    decide is choices based on model, model predictions plus politics
    Act is chnage the code and release 

    how does this help us - it goves model for how
    programmable company can work - we are seeing software eat
    the world at the observe stage - but rarely do we see a whole org
    model that is ontegrated into thise 

    AI is sorta hoped / worried it will do this second stage (and DAnd A)
    but explicitly calling itnout its clear one can easily domit
    but it challenges the existence of feudal
mgmt elite that "understands" the company

    cf VAR - "get me one single number to judge company bu"
    ok but once we do, anyone can judge it - that model is built
    it is available

    counterpojt - there are too mmay variables we have to do this by feel
    yeah bollocks

Tranisation from managers to coders 
reduces ability for non technical management 
to know what is possible and how to implement next step on phase soace

management is becoming less abke to *dirext* 
and more able to *prevent* - old saw of government having engine of lawnmower and brakes of rolls royce

leadership - saying its ok (sniper and injured enemy)

impact of remote workinng

with rmeote working either everyone is told about everything
or there is total loss of cohesion - either write it all down and lose political power or 



coders are the new managers
---------------------------

THe new workers are the CPUs. The supervisors and instructions come from the coders - and code is the design.  Look at difference between maangers in Drucker - bestriding the world making decisions, and managers in Googles eight rules - coaches helping keep the employees happy.  And what if employees are not happy - look at OpenAI where an emploee revolt removed the board.  We shall come back to employee ower later. WHy did rome collapse? Collapse of trust and trade.

management is dead - 
coders are new managers 
management is simple (peter principle) 
management can be automated - to raise floor level

modelling 
mentoring 
monitoring
politicking  (financier and project choosing) 
project / activity choice - resource allocation is mostly what *change* to apply - which is mostly a datwining process of project survival - so financing is process of finding successful projects not initiating successful projects
or finding obvious failings and initiating blessed solutions 

management training matters but 
is that training in coaching (google 8 rules) or training in project initiation and selection or training in political alignment 


i hvave sympathy woth the control freaks because there is no standrdisatikn - no process (military word??)
there is need for soijg things this way my
way - commot formats and so on

management is basically xonsrant on job training of others 
- linting humans 

we live lives of imperfection and pretend every is fine and the dodson are between the two is our stress level - but admitting the truth is a way to find calm and time to fix the imperfections

democracy
openness / search for truth / scientific method
industrial revolution - automation finance and more

politician - consensus forming / finding 
foncnciar - consensus funding
