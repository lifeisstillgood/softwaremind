Housing and Cities
==================

This is not a software-adjacnet post so it will have to move.  But I wanted to
get some thoughts down.

FIrstly, please do read / watch the excellent series of video lectures at UCL  (https://youtu.be/RX-AzKgUEWk).  There is a lot of focus on housing across the political spectrum (obviously really, its where we all live), and this is a fairly good overview of some of the hidden drivers.  Now, my summary of the thrust is

1. Land is Rentierismumumum ... in short if you own some land and
someone near you builds a town, sewer, hospital, disneyland, your land
value goes up but you did nothing, added no value, did no work.  And
that has all sorts of negative consequences.  One big one is that if
government (ie local city council) invests millions in a public
transport hub or a whatever, people around there see their land values
go up.  And if the city council then wanted to for example buy some of
that land to build bigger and better stuff, they would have to pay
thorugh the nose.

2. UK in the late 1940s had a solution for this.  100% Marginal Land
Value Tax.  Thats right. The UK decided to build "New Towns". Harlow,
Milton Keynes etc.  They are not nice places, but they are not
terrible and they worked.  mostly because the government did something
like this - "If we announce we are going to buy your field and put a
hospital and 500 houses on it, then the owners of those fields might
want to sell them.  If they sell them to some middle man for
*agricultural prices* and that middleman sells to the government for
domestic housing prices, the farmer looks silly and the government
pays about 10X.  So instead we announce that 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_and_Country_Planning_Act_1947' exists - the idea was simple.  A middleman / housing developer agrees to buy a field at an *current agricultural* price, and also agrees a tax rate to be paid after sale of the developed house.  This was a high tax - essentially taking away the increase in land price apart from the development cost plus profit.  In short, farmers could sell their fields without feeling silly.

-> why is housing somexpeonsive ?

- Criminal money laundering ?
- NIMBY
- empty homes not used for tenancy / owner occupied
- who owns what

- The reverse economic model (land banking)

- the cost of building (pre fab and labour shortage)

- the rentier problem (taxing the increase in land value due to planning permission and ancillary build (train station))

- land value taxation ? 

- last two need non market valuation to be taxed on - can this be avoided? (reasonable as if all
land was taxed much would hit market at same time to pay for tax which would reduce the sell price and hence the tax level)

- perhaps assessing the cost of local public works - people get taxed proportionately to the public spend - this means the rentier problem is mitigated but also reduces to minimum what public works are needed - why have that new road? 


MOOPs and monitoring
--------------------

We obviously have sattellitte monitoring of the world
But lookk at https://cotl.com.au/launch.html - range of weather stations monitoring for pestivcide runoff and spray.

We can moniotr the world - and improve it.
