Coders are the new managers
---------------------------
It does not matter what the managers say or ask, it does not matter what the design document says. what matters is what the code says, and does.

There are processes that improve the code and processes that dont - but in the end the code is the output, software is capital and the important parts of that are the coders.

Good management helps, but it is neither sufficnet nor probably necessary

Google has stufided this and come uo
withbeifht rules - these rules are not about making decisions or influencing the code base but basically keeping the coders happy and productive (and perhaps union free)

In fifty years the idea of management has slipped from
MBA touring behemoths bestriding the world (financiers basically) to moral officers and coaches.

Yeah some form of co-ordination is needed but thats about how to take credit fot peoples work (hierarchy getting in the way*)

Financiers are still bestriding the world - see 2 orders magnitude and the point at which shared treasury joins "right aize" companies.



Management by code 
------------------
A small side note - most of us will know a manager who "used to code but stopped when went into management". But none of us know anyone who stopped reading and writing English (German, Japanese) when they went into management.
The difference might be that we don't have many companies that can be managed with code, or that a lot of people in management don't need to be there.
Edit: VW is an interesting case in point. It does not matter what a manager says, what the design document lays out. what matters is what the code says. And VW CTO knew this so he made the commits to the code base that tricked the emissions tests. That is management-by-code.
