Coders are the New Managers

Why have managers?

But self organising sucks (structureless stuff like chiat day)
How to reward people? 
but anyway ... software 
Why need good managers ? to shield younfrom the politics and in foghting?
then the missing part is
democracy. you cannot get rid of politics - but you can 
remove the buts where individiulas are toompowerful 
Reward systems 
Video games teach us that regular frequent rewards are waay better than 
on off rewards. so why have annual appraisals - because having a manager there daily enabked daily approasals and reqard ( at least bu the good managers) 
So remotw work not somgood
having demos very good

The Architect's Paradox
=======================







An architect today can <design> a building, but leave many of the detaisl to be
worked out
at construction time (they of course need to ensure load bearing floors etc etc. But often
this not work out - see NEw York famous.) But imagine we create a robot that injects
concrete exactly where its told. At this point te architect can churn out hundreds of
buildings at a time, but they need to specify *everytrhing*.  This is the problem,
opportunity and promise of software as it eats the world - vast savings, vast control, but
now everything must be much more explicit.

The code is the design
=========================







Articles and discussion - when build is deterministic, the code is the design.
SO from now
on we see a world of programmable companies which are franchises, with a franchise of one.
 Real working policy documents. The goal of SOPpy is to partly allow one to write code
that runs a company, but also to write policy documents that read as policy but execute as
code. Cucumber

Chapter: software is disaggeegating management 
===============================================







  - how do companies decide?
    robotics useful 
    simple terms - OODA loop 
    observe is perception - collection of data
    orient is collating data into a model that 
    is an effective representation of reality 
    decide is choices based on model, model predictions plus politics
    Act is chnage the code and release 
    how does this help us - it goves model for how
    programmable company can work - we are seeing software eat
    the world at the observe stage - but rarely do we see a whole org
    model that is ontegrated into thise 
    AI is sorta hoped / worried it will do this second stage (and DAnd A)
    but explicitly calling itnout its clear one can easily domit
    but it challenges the existence of feudal
mgmt elite that "understands" the company
    cf VAR - "get me one single number to judge company bu"
    ok but once we do, anyone can judge it - that model is built
    it is available
    counterpojt - there are too mmay variables we have to do this by feel
    yeah bollocks

  - Coders are the new managers, CPUs are the new workers (as almost every job has co-pilot or enabled by software / robot / machine)

    "When Adam Delved and Eve span, who then was a Gentleman?"
    
    -- John Ball, (Peasants' Revolt) 1381
Tranisation from managers to coders 
reduces ability for non technical management 
to know what is possible and how to implement next step on phase soace
management is becoming less abke to *dirext* 
and more able to *prevent* - old saw of government having engine of lawnmower and brakes of rolls royce
leadership - saying its ok (sniper and injured enemy)

with rmeote working either everyone is told about everything
or there is total loss of cohesion - either write it all down and lose political power or 
coders are the new managers
---------------------------






THe new workers are the CPUs. The supervisors and instructions come from the coders - and code is the design.  Look at difference between maangers in Drucker - bestriding the world making decisions, and managers in Googles eight rules - coaches helping keep the employees happy.  And what if employees are not happy - look at OpenAI where an emploee revolt removed the board.  We shall come back to employee ower later. WHy did rome collapse? Collapse of trust and trade.
management is dead - 
coders are new managers 
management is simple (peter principle) 
management can be automated - to raise floor level
modelling 
mentoring 
monitoring
politicking  (financier and project choosing) 
project / activity choice - resource allocation is mostly what *change* to apply - which is mostly a datwining process of project survival - so financing is process of finding successful projects not initiating successful projects
or finding obvious failings and initiating blessed solutions 
management training matters but 
is that training in coaching (google 8 rules) or training in project initiation and selection or training in political alignment 
i hvave sympathy woth the control freaks because there is no standrdisatikn - no process (military word??)
there is need for soijg things this way my
way - commot formats and so on
management is basically xonsrant on job training of others 
- linting humans 
we live lives of imperfection and pretend every is fine and the dodson are between the two is our stress level - but admitting the truth is a way to find calm and time to fix the imperfections 
the great innovations of 1776 enlightenment 
democracy
openness / search for truth / scientific method
industrial revolution - automation finance and more
double down on what works
politician - consensus forming / finding 
foncnciar - consensus funding

Non Jobs
=========






Non Jobs 80% of 80% -> 96% from 36%. How project manaement will be removed from companies
as
      co-ordination is driven through test rigs and APIs and 'measure of progress is
workig software' A screed against project maangement-ism.  Also why are companies not
using metrics and data to drive outcomes - AB testing your way  to success? Or to be out
of a job?

The SDLC - Literate Best Practise / The DevManual
=================================================






Many pieces combine to make modern SDLC - see Joels 12 rules. Policy as code. Software
givernance matters - see trolley problems, voting on PRs and VW scandal. End of commerical
confidentiality.
simplest possible complete software ecosystem - devmanual

Chapter: Literary Best practise
===============================







Software demands different best practises
We are finding them - and what it will look like makes WaPo different to a
medieval scriptoreum.
Prod-Parallel and back testing,
Tool use
COmmon solutions (octavio, editing)
THis is The DevManual
To "manage" you need to have an OODA loop.
To "release with confidence" you need to have a prod-parallel env / test rig.
To "plan" you need to have failing tests in the prod-parallel env, that are like
bug bounties for employees.  DO not fall for capitalism here, use socialism
inside the org.
Chapter OODA loop and production ready, tech debt.
==================================================






Observe, Orientate, Decide, Act.
This is operating *on* an existing system. We are managing the system.
If we cannot get metrics from the system, we cannot observe
If we do not have a (software) model of the system we cannot orientate,
(use of Statitical process control)
Deciding is politics - persuasion, allocation of resources, collection of
resources.
Act is development
The main issue is we have *assumed* the model is in the managers head, or
in their holy spreadsheet.  Possibly because the numbers in the sheet are
'dangerous' to pass around.
But with software metrics, thats a choice not a requirement. A model can be
"soft real time" updated, and the VAR number calculated each day.
Deciding is affected to, as differnet costly options can be appplied to model
and prod-parallel for analysis.
And Act is the art of filling in the red failing tests in the prod-parallel.
