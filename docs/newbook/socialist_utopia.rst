WE live in one. We are dependanet on people we simply dont know. Terry pratchett quote about big lies like truth justice. Other lie is that people will trade without trust. People will self harm without knowing a way back.  Northern Ireland is as good as it gets.  HOw do we build trust in societies and in organisations?
