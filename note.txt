Using SteveY's rant
we see
1. API SOA is the right way

2. lots to learn from amazon

3. that testing is an interesting apprpach - QA and unit tests lie on a
spectrum, and that have solid production monitoirng is effectively having solid testing.  I go for doctests and QA tests as the right balance - too much mocking is too much mucking about.  You seem to get concetpually the right level of breakdown. not the level for your testing tool.  Having more test code than actual code is *not* a positive.

4. also interesting view on coase - not merely size of pizza team, but
reuse of code as a metric of organisational cohesion - start up to spreadeagled.
Lots of companies have many ways to do same thing.  But there should be one right way to do it. Look at xkcd cartoon - 14 different standards.  A cohesive org has one common standard - by fiat or by discussion.  If an org is happy to allow many flowers to bloom to find the right way then frankly its a community not an atomic unit.
