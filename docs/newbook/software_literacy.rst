"""because it actually winds up being less DevOps work, on average, to support open-source systems running on bare VMs, than to try to keep up with Google’s deprecation treadmill.
Before I return to shitting on Google Cloud Platform, because boyo I am nowhere near finished yet, let’s go visit how software engineering works in some other domains. Google engineers pride themselves on their software engineering discipline, and that’s actually what gets them into trouble. Pride is a trap for the unwary, and it has ensnared many a Google team into thinking that their decisions are always right, and that correctness (by some vague fuzzy definition) is more important than customer focus.

thenimportant bit here is twofold - one relax views on clous
second, customer focus. notnmerwly good business support (once we click buy everythingnbecomes cost centre or cost reduction)
but focusing onnhumans is how we define value!!!

there is no objective view of value - except
maybe innaciences where value is does it work not does it sell


thoughts: changing company means software goves you do-overs 
think how so much filmmproduction is in post VFX
its less costy do-overs for production - not everyone can do zipper project mgmt

software advarages over accountancy (15th c control)
- things arent communtative 1x7 not same as 7x1
rory sutherland and amazon 
- taxtics and strategy cannot be purely logical - because humans arent due to game theory / having an enemy
- so literacy allows symbolic amnioulation of models of reality
- the thing is you can bake in super fast always onteaction woth preprogrammed non logical activity
AI cant but programmers can 

we like rory - cos software is not form of engineering 
it is linking the robotic perceptors and sensors to the robotic actuators 
but it is doing so for human startegic and tactica reasons 
human loteracy encodes human 

we want out sensors to be as close to reality as possible we want our models of the world to be close to reality
but we wnat our decisions to be human - because most decision have another human at the other end 

in short if we want there to be rules to decisoonnmaking we bee do create the market and laws for those riles to be "downhill"

we cannot onjectively engineer most software because most software is about human to human interaction not measure photons from distant stars 


..   literacy is a technology, as indeed is speech and perhaps thought? story of
     olphulla goth germainic invents alphanet and writes it down - literacy
     matters  as a technology the blub paradox and software literacy - you
     cannot have large  software literate company without having all literate
    employees - its like  mechanised warfare or gengis khan you can only move
    the whole army when   everyone  is on horseback - speed of sound
     Implications across board
    democractic bet, state needs educated citizens - but that implies citizens
    who choose - see why not teach slaves to read

The warfare of Genghis Khan
===========================

From the turn of the first millenium AD, Eurasia had a generation or two of
warmer weather across the continent [#01]_.  In Western Europe we saw Crusades
and the beginnings of the East West Schism, but thousands of miles to the east,
the nomadic Mongolian people had grown in population and wealth, and were
bumping up against the settled peoples of China and the Silk Road.  A tribal
leader's son, Temushin, later to be known as Gengis Khan, underwent an
biopic-worthy lifetime, from priviledged warrior to outcast, to war leader and
finally founder of a nation.  (Oh, and brutal mass killer, lets not forget that
bit.)

Ever since the dawn of agriculture (about 9000BCE) there has been a border
tension between the nomadic cultures and the settled cultures (roughly described
as we can raid you and get away faster than you can react, and we can build
walls we can hide behind).  This time it was more than a raid - this time there
were a *lot* of Mongols.

Tribal internecine warfare had always bedevilled Mongolian unity, and Gengis
Khan solved this by absorbing defeated tribes into a new model of army. the
smallest unit of the army was a mounted cavalry unit of ten men, an `aravt` with
layers of `aravt` strung together in a military hierarchy reaching up to
something like a modern day "division" of 10,000 horse borne warriors. Important
to maintaining *Mongolian* loyalty as opposed to *tribal* loyalty,  each aravt
was always made up of men from many different tribes, so that the army cohesion
was based around loyalty to the Great Khan, not to family.  He turned the tribal
loyalty to a loyalty to the `aravt`, and hence the Khan.

For us the most important lesson is they were all mounted on horses. Not "just"
the cavalry, but *the whole army, and its tail of civilians*.  Mongolia was a
horse culture, and everything from family to trade was conducted on the back of
horses. Horses that moved faster than people.

A medieval army (and indeed ancient and classical) basically moved at human
walking pace. And as the head of a column had to make camp till the rear caught
up, generally 10 miles a day was a *good* pace for much of human history.
Cavalry could move quickly, but the whole army was limited to the speed of its
slowest walker.

Mongolia's horse based steppe culture, lived entirely in the saddle they
basically *all had a horse*, and so they *all moved at horse pace*.
Everything in an `aravt` was on horseback - tents, weapons, food and utensils.
So the whole army could travel - usually 50-60 miles per day.  During Subotai's
raids on Eastern Europe, (after Gengis' death so around 1220s) the `Rus`, the
Hungarians, the Bulgarians and others were devastated as they tried to catch an
army of 90,000 that could travel in a day what they could only manage in a week.
Of course European armies had horses, indeed European cavalry out-matched
Mongolian light cavalry, weight for weight, armour for armour - but the *rest of
the European army* was on foot or in a cart, and so the army could only move at
the pace of the walking foot soldier.  But the Mongols, their whole army could
move at the medieval equivalent of supersonic travel (See www.acoup.blog
[#02]_). As medieval communication was almost totally based on messages passed
on foot, the Mongol Army moved *faster than the news of their passing.*

A similar effect is found in modern (post WW1 and WWII) army developments. The
tank arrived too late in WWI to have much strategic impact, but the German
Blitzkrieg perfected in Spain, showed that fast *cavalry raids* would enable
strategic wins in Europe.  But even so the Panzer divisions often exceeded their
own supply lines. Todays "top tier" armies are hugely expensive to maintain,
because once you have a tank, you need to put the fuel, ammunition, food, cooks,
mechanics, and everything else in vehicles that can move and importantly are not
easy to kill (there is a sort of tiering of armour, from vehicles on the
battlefield to vehicles carrying the ovens. But they all need to move, and all
need to at least provide some protection)

(This got notably worse with airpower, with Vietnam being perhaps the height of
"put everything into a helicopter", but the logistics for that became too
unwieldy, or perhaps too costly.  And its an open question if that same failure
for helicopters is a indicator for electric vehicles.  There just are not any
viable commerical 16-wheeler lorries, because the electirc battery equivalent of
the rocket equation hurts quite quickly.  And its not clear if the electric tank
can be a real thing.  If not, then sustaining a petrol driven army when the
industrial base is moving to electric looks tricky.)

Just like Gengis Khan the WWII and post WWII planners saw advantages in speed,
and the need to make everything *mobile*.
Steve Jobs dexcribed computers as bicycles of mind.  I desribe software as
literacy. I conjecture there are huge adavtages in speed and agility in running
software.

We are at the "oh look tanks work well" stage.  How we transition companies and
organistions to the "oh everything needs to be mobile now" is one of the
fundamental themese of this book.

Everyone is able to communicate via softwre, to read the code and understand
what is going on. Not have to be slowed down by translations into and out of
policy documents. And be shackled by lack of testing and modelling.
Some people think AI will magivally do this for us. One of my conjectures is "If
you think AI can magically solve your business problems tomorrow, you can solve
them today with software and determination."

The future belongs to the literate
----------------------------------

Many many years ago, I found myself standing in a cavernous room underneath a
bustling, noisy pub in London's Covent Garden.  It was a fine Summers day and
the evening is sharply cooking.
I look around at the 90-odd developers, graduates and entrepreneurs in
the room, and, as I have been persuaded to sponsor this meeting, now
all I have to do is give a quick speech.
I never quite know what to do for these sort of speeches - so I decide
to give a history lesson. Yes. A history lesson. Gripping stuff, some
were even rolling their eyes in excitement.
It's a good one though. You see, in 1454, Johannes Gutenberg printed
the first of his Bibles using movable type - and ushered in a new era
of literacy and communication. Printing books was now orders of
magnitude cheaper, and there was an explosion of publishing.
The number of published books leapt from an estimated 30,000 books *in all of
Europe in 1450* to 12 million books by 1500.  Think about that. A decent sized
(and horrendously under funded) library today, in many large towns in England
will have 30,000 books.  More than were in the whole of Europe before the
printing press. [#]_
Within a generation literacy in Western Europe had leapt from under 2%
to well over 20% - and it changed everything. Martin Luther was able
to nail a piece of paper to a church door and expect most members of
the middle-class congregation to simply read it, not have it read to
them by clergy. (Plus the subsequent decasdes of debates would be in
published letters, pamphlets and otehr ways for one person to
mass-communicate with many). Books on mathematics and navigation enabled the
training of middle-class merchantmen who would then dare, only 40
years later, to cross the Atlantic.
A better suit
=============







Now I used to feel smug about my nice little Printing Press literacy theory (it
was a while ago).  But I remember attending `Sprint 16` the UK's Government's
tech fest, and the Cabinet Office Minister standing up and spouting pretty much
the same concept.  Nothing stops smugness like a national politician using your
lines.  It makes you wonder what you have misunderstood.
The answer is of course plenty.  The above is too pat. Too simple.
It leaves out the geo-politics of Europe, how the specific cultural
geological and economic circumstances of different countries allowed and
encouraged the spread of literacy and enlightenment.  But it is a good enough
argument. The core is directionally correct (in my view) and moving in the
right direction is always a win.
Before people wandered off to the bar I decided to let them know why
they were getting my best Simon Scharma impression.
Because, in my view, and remember they were eating my sausage rolls,
so that counts, in my view we are entering the age of a new form of
literacy - *software literacy.*
Even in the 15th century, nations, companies and guilds and churches
competed, and ran international concerns. But somewhere between
Gutenberg's Bible and Luther's 95 Theses these companies changed. Not
with business process re-engineering, or total quality circles - but
changed like leaving the water and walking on land changed.
I have no idea how to quantify the advantages a company whose staff can all read
and write will have over a company whose staff are all or mostly illiterate.
It's not one of lower labour cost, or better marketing, it's something
else...Deep in our bones we *know* that literacy changes everything. Its so
built into us and into everyone we know that we cannot imagine a world where we
cannot read or write.
Anyway, you, like the poor people wanting to get to the bar, can see
where I am taking this. The ability to marshal knowledge, to code and
compile and compute, the natural inclination to arrange the world so
it can be iterated over, the ability to turn a business from a
medieval scriptorium into an automated system is *software literacy*.
The final shape of a software literate company is probably unguessable
to us, in the same way that an airports departures board was
unguessable to Pope Pius II, or that a major newspaper run by
illiterate editors will look and work nothing like the Washington
Post. But we can be sure they are coming. And we can make sensible
predictions about what they will and won't be.
Everyone can read, everyone is on a horse
=========================================







So, yeah. I am postulating, conjecturing and all those other things that
justify "gut feel after 30 years of working in software".
Create a company, a society, where everyone has not just a computer, but the
coding skills needed to use it (not just clicky button), create an environment
where that code is readable (I mean, we can read our own laws (even if we never
bother)) and then ask - what does a company like that look like? WHat is the
difference between working inside that company, and working on the softwre that
runs the company?
Only when a critical mass of people in a company are software literate
can that company hope to become *programmable*.
The software mind can be seen as the mind of a literate software developer.
Or it can be seen as the controlling mind of an organisation, of a society.
::
  Software Reliability Engineering (SRE) is what happens when
  you ask a developer to design an operations team.
Google is justifiably proud of its' SRE teams - developing their own
software to run the computers, data centres, networks and release
processes that their success stood on was the only way to work at
web-scale.  The concept of "DevOps" and "SRE" are now embedded in
the minds of modern managers, few will admit they fall short.
But another quote might help::
    We see the benefits of computers everywhere, at home, at work,
    except in the productivity statistics.
    -- Robert Solow
    (https://eml.berkeley.edu/~bhhall/e124/David90_dynamo.pdf)
I have a simple argument - he is correct, not because software and
computers cannot help but because they are not well used.  It would be
like complaining that we see notepads and pencils everywhere, except
in the productivity statistics, but only to discover that most people
cannot read and write and are just carrying the notepads around
because they dont want to be left out.
So, if SRE is what we get when developers design an operations team::
   A Programmable Company is what you get when you ask a developer to
   design a company.
   But what do we get when we ask developers to design a whole society?
If you understand grammar, sentence structure, paragraphs, chapters,
character development and three-act story structure, you can write
a OK-ish novel about pretty much anything.
If you cannot read or write, have never heard of a character arc, and
your bonus depends on it, then the novel you write is likely to make
as much sense as the Kafka-esque companies most of us work in.
Its simple.  But very hard to change.
Double down on what works
--------------------------







If asked to describe my politic, I would be boringly middle of the road,
except in discussions of child protection
where my position would be something like right of Genghis.
But that is becasue I am a product of a very weird time - a time where democracy
become the dominant culture, and out of that culture sprang one, two or three
industrial revolutions.  And those industrial revolutions allowed scientific
discoveries and their global implementations to make it possible for 8 billion
people to live on a planet that could barely support 1 billion a 150 years
before.
Which is a long winded way of saying we have a long way to fall.
Unless we invent fusion reactors, or discover how to pull energy from Dark
Matter, or make a *lot* more solar panels, humans are going to have to get
a lot lot better at doing more with less.
The productivity gains of the computer remain unrealised, the shared
understanding of common mental models remain politically devisive,
The Democratic Bet
------------------







We have two ways to go - use software and ledgers, and communication and
tracking to *control* people as in TOtalitatianism, or to empower
and free people as in democracy.  (and no we are not there yet, its laong road)
- transparency, democracy, openness, empiricism, competition these are the
things to double down on.
