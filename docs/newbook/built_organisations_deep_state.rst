Built Organisations, Deep State
-------------------------------

Organisations are *built* for certain purposes. The infrastructure forces a certain capability - its hard to make a tank force trasnform to an air force without major capital investment.  But they also have the Slow AI built in - they *think* in certain ways.  Deep State (pace the fake news spin) is where it is hard to change the processes that you do not know about.
