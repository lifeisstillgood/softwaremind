Why ooen source is alwys under funded

Schumpeter pointed out that innovation is rarely the result of free market regimes but instead of monopolistic competition. A situation in which individual winners temporarily capture markets and use high surplus returns to fund fundamentally expensive innovation. In dynamic economies usually a handful of firms dominate in the medium term. They're replaced across time, they don't compete in the same space. More and more complex and developed economies naturally move towards this because progress requires immense capital.
Under conditions of extremely free markets firms profits are reduced due to competition, consumers capture immediate value, but the sectors remain stagnant. An example are many service industries.
This also applies to open source software. it is by its nature extremely competitive and as a result almost all value is captured by its users. This is great at any given point in time, but it also means that open source software is constantly underfunded, and research is in fact ironically driven by surpluses of large firms.


this os why we need some surpkus but drmocratic control over surplus.  either we give up capialism or we find a way to have democracy in companies

overwhelming importance of daily build as focus

Fascinating free book that motivated these comments:

"Between 1919 and 1941, the U.S. Navy transformed itself from a powerful if unsophisticated force into the fleet that won a two-ocean war. The great puzzle of U.S. naval history is how that was accomplished. This book argues that war gaming at the U.S. Naval War College made an enormous, and perhaps decisive, contribution."

Coase and theiry of firm

Heading to software socialism 

what was sumpathetic now antagobiticd - capislism and freedom, cars and urban?? 

is capitalism and fredom antagnistic? Or is how companies are set up self defeating? https://acoup.blog/2023/06/09/fireside-friday-june-9-2023 - argument is russia set up military to fight each othe rprevent coup. see black bs white in USa nut not the marine corp giving up their tanks

also UK empire was about learning that we no longer invaded and took territory cos terrotory less valuabke thab facotries.  we just invaded to get either cheap raw materials or exclusive markets.  
US empire just leanrt better and never properly invaded just insisted on both with menaces 

perhaps freedom and democracy and a voice is roght way to attcot 

issue is tyranny and totalitarianism vs freeom - of you dont think aoftware will bind us try being a amazon worker or a gog worker - we need yo build freedom into the code, and have the code reviewable - the fights of equality will be fights over reading the code that runs the toilet breaks for workers 

Aoftware tyranny - management is about buikding systmes for lower level - which is simple with software (ie gog workers) which means we shall see lots of management fired as you sont need so much but also 

central difficukty is going to be antognistic relationship between repace managenr with software and have human creative 

how allow freedom in compnaies and capitalism - how build in software for choice (mateix?) 


so we tie in coders are new managers, tyranny vs freedom
not capitalism ca communism (and we dont have the advantage so we need to practise freedom in our orgabisatikns else they wont have the edge - and we need to replace hero managers with consensus sensible policies - building this through Rawls social hustice) 

collapse of civilisation

After rome collapsed you would have thought people would try to leep hot baths and concrete and cement. But no.

is this economic thing - vast numbers of country trying to feed small numbers coty dwellers.  not really cos the country folk jad somewhere to sell aurplus so everyone wins.

My fonal thought - we recognise that govingnpeople freedom is giving them freedom to do shitty trrrible things (that arent actually outlawed - see I hope you die of cancer, or just lying on the internet).  reformation is followed by counter reformation as culture wars continue.

my final thought is that we want our culture war to be won by our side. the side of aspiration.  to aspire to wisdom, intellignece, kindness, to dare new grwat things and procide wealth and support for all.  We need to teach, inculcate aspiration in our children - and set role models to be better - to build systems that rachet us higher, not drag us down, to practise freedom democracy and choice at home at school at work so when it is challenged innand ourside our scoiety we have the muscle memory yo withstand it

(more on money as a counter not reality.  accountancy is only abke toncount money but software can count anything it's symbolic) 

look tax first then spend is how you manage when what you have is accountancy

but that's not what economy is - tax is way to control inflation but what we want is to repurpose some of the resources

which is why controlling via software is more direct more tyranny terrifying and more future 

we have learnt that open markets do not breed open societies - china has done open markets and closed societies

so we need to learn to build openness into our software and our societies - 


we need civil servants paid enough that they can resist the calls of corruption 99% of the time and enough enforcement to catch the rest 

but that gets harder the further apart the top 0.1% get - income equality is a matter of national security 
Democratic parties, 
hitler and the SA and 
taking over an organisation

but if the org runs on polirices itnwill run on software guided oolicies whichbwill be a programmabel compnay - so hitler wont need SA next time and maybe presidents wont need Party supoort 

Hitlers choice vs churchills choice - and its the choice of a config statemebt - thats what we need thats who we cote for - and we need to take the cote seriously 

Also - escalation theory does not facour the free nation but the richest (or at least one with most capable conventional
military - which does not nexesaarily mean free (bit see corruotion)

history philosophy and future of software

Some basic themes and chapters

Themes:
Democracy - science, freedom, systems not heroics, not capitalism but freedom.





.. ::

  	Capitalism won, but it was not capitalism vs   communism - it was liberty vs tyranny and capitalism was just the weapon.  We are still fighting liberty v tyranny but the other side has same weapons and equally good training and doctrine

  we need to be shining beacon on a hill, not better at firing our weapons.
